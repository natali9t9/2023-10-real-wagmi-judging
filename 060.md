# Missing check for `sqrtRatioAX96 > 0`
## Summary
When `sqrtRatioAX96` is zero, it can lead to problematic calculations, such as division by zero or other errors. Uniswap V3 addresses a similar concern by incorporating a requirement `require(sqrtRatioAX96 > 0)`, which ensures that `sqrtRatioAX96` is always greater than zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmount0ForLiquidity()` function, there is an issue with `sqrtRatioAX96` not being checked for a value of 0 before performing calculations. If `sqrtRatioAX96` is 0, it could lead to problematic calculations, possibly resulting in division by zero or other errors.
In [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/60de80a37b26e4d36bd573430b5b4bf53d0a3d36/contracts/libraries/SqrtPriceMath.sol#L159), a similar calculation is safeguarded with the requirement `require(sqrtRatioAX96 > 0)` to ensure that `sqrtRatioAX96` is not zero, preventing potential issues. The absence of such a check in this code could pose a risk in scenarios where `sqrtRatioAX96` might become 0, and it's essential to validate this value to ensure the correctness and safety of the calculations.
```solidity
function getAmount0ForLiquidity(
        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96,
        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96,
        uint128 liquidity
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amount0) {
        if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96)
            (sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96) = (sqrtRatioBX96, sqrtRatioAX96);

        return
            FullMath.mulDiv(
                uint256(liquidity) << FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION,
                sqrtRatioBX96 - sqrtRatioAX96,
                sqrtRatioBX96
            ) / sqrtRatioAX96;
    }


function getAmount0Delta(uint160 sqrtRatioAX96, uint160 sqrtRatioBX96, uint128 liquidity, bool roundUp)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256 amount0)
    {
        unchecked {
            if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96) (sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96) = (sqrtRatioBX96, sqrtRatioAX96);

            uint256 numerator1 = uint256(liquidity) << FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION;
            uint256 numerator2 = sqrtRatioBX96 - sqrtRatioAX96;

            require(sqrtRatioAX96 > 0);

            return roundUp
                ? UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(numerator1, numerator2, sqrtRatioBX96), sqrtRatioAX96)
                : FullMath.mulDiv(numerator1, numerator2, sqrtRatioBX96) / sqrtRatioAX96;
        }
    }

```

## Impact
