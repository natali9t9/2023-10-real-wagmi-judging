# Do not use abi.encode to interact with ERC20 functions
## Summary
Wrongly encoded calls are not detected by the compiler and revert at runtime.

## Vulnerability Detail
While sometimes the contract uses the IERC20 interface to interact with tokens, other times it does use raw call encoding. This results in a incosistent implementation. Also, all the token interactions can be done safe and efficiently with specific libraries such as Solady's SafeTransferLib

```solidity 
/**
     * @dev This internal function attempts to approve a specific amount of tokens for a spender.
     * It performs a call to the `approve` function on the token contract using the provided parameters,
     * and returns a boolean indicating whether the approval was successful or not.
     * @param token The address of the token contract.
     * @param spender The address of the spender.
     * @param amount The amount of tokens to be approved.
     * @return A boolean indicating whether the approval was successful or not.
     */
    function _tryApprove(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) private returns (bool) {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, amount)
        );
        return success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool)));
    }
```
## Impact
Low, since the code has been tested.
