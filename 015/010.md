# Vulnerability in Address Check within the ``transferToken`` Function
## Summary
In the ``transferToken`` function of the application, there is no check to verify whether the ``_to`` address is address 0 (0x0) before conducting a fund transfer, which can potentially pose a security issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the source code, the ``transferToken`` function allows transferring funds from the ``_token`` address to the _to address if the ``_amount`` is positive. However, the function does not check the ``_to`` address before executing the transfer. If ``_to`` is the address 0 (0x0), the transaction will proceed without any validation, resulting in funds being sent to an invalid address, with no possibility of recovery.

## Impact
Risk of fund loss: This vulnerability can lead to funds being sent to an invalid address (0x0) with no possibility of recovery.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/Vault.sol#L17-L21

```solidity
function transferToken(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_amount > 0) {
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform a check on the _to address before executing the fund transfer. Here's an improved code snippet:

```solidity
function transferToken(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(_to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
    require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
}
```

By adding two require statements, ensure that ``_to`` is not address 0 and that ``_amount`` is greater than 0 before executing the transfer.
