# ERC20 transfer return value not checked
## Summary
ERC20 `transfer` function returns a boolean, should be checked. Found in `transferToken` of `Vault`

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens dont revert when `transfer` fails but they return false instead.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Transfers tokens to a specified address
     * @param _token The address of the token to be transferred
     * @param _to The address to which the tokens will be transferred
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to be transferred
     */
    function transferToken(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_amount > 0) {
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
    }

```
## Impact
Low in this case, because it doesn't affect to the protocol, but it could be worse.
