# Malicious liquidity provider may burn their LP NFT to make liquidations impossible and cause protocol to incur bad debt
## Summary
A malicious Liquidity Provider, who is ready to sacrifice some funds against the protocol (e.g. be a griefer or a competitor or if there is a protocol token in the future, have an intention of profit from short selling during a value dump), may burn his LP NFT while a borrow is taken against this LP NFT and as an effect, there will be no possibility to liquidate position(s) related to this loan. Due to this, a bad debt will keep incurring on that position, without possibility to really recover it in other way than just paying for it infinitely.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume Bob is a liquidity provider who approved his liquidity to the protocol. He does this by calling approve of his Uniswapv3 NFT to the protocol. During a borrow operation Bob's liquidity is decreased, which the protocol can do [because its approved](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L185), but the LP still is the disponent and the owner of the LP NFT. He still is capable of decreasing liquidity too and collecting the fees too, by approving to the protocol he just authorized the protocol do to it too, but doesnt lose that permission. In order to `burn` the NFT, Bob has to [clear](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L379) his position which means decrease liquidity to zero and `collect` all the fees. [Here is the burn function for reference](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L377-L382).
As a result of burn, the owner becomes address(0) as the token should not exist anymore. This leads to unexpected implications described in the `Code Snippet` section. Although Bob will not be able to get his liquidity back, but if he's a malicious user, or a competition-sponsored actor, this cost may be still justified for him. 

## Impact
A position related to that loan will not be repayable, attempt to liquidate(repay) it will end up with a revert, since it will not be possible to send back `holdToken` to `address(0)`. An irrecoverable bad debt will arise and will keep growing with time as per the interest rate for each position affected.

## Code Snippet
There are few cases where the debt can be repaid and all depend on the loan NFT owner (`creditor`)
in `repay`, if its not an emergency repayment (which wont be the case here because the LPer is malicious), the complete of repayment relies on [_restoreLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L650). If all further swaps succeed, anyway at some point in any loop that includes malicious liquidity, [here creditor of burned token will be address zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L306) and [here it will revert due to transfer to zero address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L315).

```solidity
            address creditor = underlyingPositionManager.ownerOf(loan.tokenId);
           [...]
            Vault(VAULT_ADDRESS).transferToken(cache.holdToken, creditor, liquidityOwnerReward);
```

[transferToken is defined here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/Vault.sol#L17-L21) and uses safeTransfer of ERC20, which [disallows transfer](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L175-L176) to zero address.

Transferring the ownership of the debt will not be a solution here because the debt will still be the debt. Therefore in fact, a malicious LPer may bring the protocol into a broken state just by settling his debts with uniswap directly and burning his LP NFT right after.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol should not rely on the owner to still be owning the NFT, however there is no straightforward solution to it. One can be to either save the primary owner address, but then if he will be selling or transferring his NFT, then the transfer may reach improper destination. Other way, might be to use the VAULT additionally as an escrow, (or other, separate contract) where the funds are send back and are redeemable by the creditor. To make things easier, it may auto-transfer these funds periodically, which adds some complexity, but the liquidations/repayments does not rely on the owner being the owner anymore.
