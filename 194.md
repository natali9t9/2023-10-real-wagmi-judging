# owner of Ownable.sol is not set by default
### Summary
The owner account will not be the one that deploys the contract and should provided as a constructor argument during deployment.

### Vulnerability Details

In openzeppelin v5 we need to explicitely initialize ownable constructor by giving initial owner in arguments but In above codes no call to Ownable(_owner) in it's constructor.

### Impact
In case of upgradable contract If we don't initialize ownable explicitely then contract is deployed without owner and In case of non-upgradeable scenario It faces Compilation error.

### Recommendation

Initialize Ownable explicitly by providing Ownable(initialOwner) in the constructor.
