# The protocol isn't going to work with difference decimals other than 18
## Summary
The protocol isn't going to work with difference decimals other than 18

## Vulnerability Detail
On borrowing the dailyRateCollateralBalance is sum with the COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION that is 1e18, if you want to borrow 2 decimals token, this mean that dailyRateCollateralBalance is 10^16 greater than the borrowed amount, this means, that if you want to pay with gemini USD you need to give 10^16 times more than the actual amount,

On the other hand, if you are giving token that has 24 decimals like YAM-V2, the user will pay 10^6 times lower than the actual amount

## Impact
Loss of funds

## Recommendation
dont use COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION, but use the token.decimal()
