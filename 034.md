# New borrowers can manipulate the accrued loan rate per second when taking over the debt
## Summary
The takeOverDebt function allows the new borrower to provide the accrued loan rate instead of persisting the rate from the old borrowing
• The accrued loan rate is passed in to _initOrUpdateBorrowing from the new borrower.
• It is not inherited from the old borrowing's rate.
• This allows the new borrower to provide a lower rate, reducing their interest fees.


## Vulnerability Detail 
The takeOverDebt function allows the new borrower to provide the accrued loan rate instead of persisting the rate from the old borrowing

The key points are:
1. In takeOverDebt, the new borrower provides the accLoanRatePerSeconds
2. This is passed to _initOrUpdateBorrowing and set as the rate for the new borrowing
3. The old rate is not carried over or validated against the new rate
4. This allows the new borrower to manipulate the accrued rate lower than the actual rate
5.  Reducing the accrued rate would make their collateral requirements lower

**Here is the relevant code:**

      function takeOverDebt(bytes32 borrowingKey, uint256 collateralAmt) external {

        // New borrower provides accLoanRatePerSeconds
        accLoanRatePerSeconds = holdTokenRateInfo.accLoanRatePerSeconds;

        // Rate passed to _initOrUpdateBorrowing
        _initOrUpdateBorrowing(
              oldBorrowing.saleToken,
              oldBorrowing.holdToken,
              accLoanRatePerSeconds
      );

      }

      function _initOrUpdateBorrowing(
        // Sets provided rate without validation
        borrowing.accLoanRatePerSeconds = accLoanRatePerSeconds;
      
This could allow the new borrower to take over debt cheaply by manipulating the accrued rate. 

This means the new borrower can provide any value they want for accLoanRatePerSeconds.
The accLoanRatePerSeconds represents the accumulated loan interest rate per second for the debt. It is used to calculate the fees owed when closing the position.
By letting the new borrower manipulate this value on takeover, they can incorrectly calculate the fees owed to underpay when closing the position.

## Impact
• It allows the new borrower to potentially commit fraud by underpaying the loan interest fees on closure.
• The lender will lose money, since the new borrower repays less than they owe due to the lower manipulated accrued loan rate.
• It compromises the integrity of the accrued loan rates in the system

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It could be mitigated by persisting the rate from the previous borrowing:

      // Take over debt

      // Retrieve previous rate
      uint256 oldRate = oldBorrowing.accLoanRatePerSeconds;

      // Pass old rate to _initOrUpdateBorrowing
      _initOrUpdateBorrowing(
        oldBorrowing.saleToken, 
        oldBorrowing.holdToken,
        oldRate
      );

      // _initOrUpdateBorrowing

      // Set rate from previous borrowing 
      borrowing.accLoanRatePerSeconds = oldRate;

This would prevent the new borrower from manipulating the accrued loan rate.
