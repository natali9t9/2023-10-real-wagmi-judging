# The borrower may be unable to repay a loan
## Summary
During the repay process, the protocol will transfer hold token to creditor. However, if the USDC contract blacklists the creditor, the liquidation transaction will be revert. As a result, the borrower will unable to be repay if they have been blacklisted by the USDC token contract.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `_restoreLiquidity()`, the protocol will transfers cache.holdToken to the creditor. If cache.holdToken is USDT or USDC and the creditor has been blacklisted, the transfer will fail, preventing the borrower from repaying.
```solidity
 _increaseLiquidity(cache.saleToken, cache.holdToken, loan, amount0, amount1);
            uint256 liquidityOwnerReward = FullMath.mulDiv(
                params.totalfeesOwed,
                cache.holdTokenDebt,
                params.totalBorrowedAmount
            ) / Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;

            Vault(VAULT_ADDRESS).transferToken(cache.holdToken, creditor, liquidityOwnerReward);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }


```

## Impact
This will error where transferring USDC tokens to blacklisted users can cause the transaction to be reverted, disrupting the repay flow. The repay process might DoS
