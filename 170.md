# Redundant deadline mechanism in LiquidationBorrowingManager possibly leading to postperiod calls.
## Summary
In LiquidationBorrowingManager.sol the function [`borrow(BorrowParams calldata params, uint256 deadline)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L465) and [`repay(RepayParams calldata params, uint256 deadline)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L532) do not use the `deadline` parameter in order to enforce a borrowing validation period or repayment validation period.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `borrow()` and `repay()` in LiquidationBorrowingManager.sol do not use the function parameter `deadline` of type `uint256` effectively making it redundant to the protocol, due to the fact that the modifier [`checkDeadline(uint256 deadline)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L136) only checks that the `deadline` input paramter is greater than the current block timestamp.

## Impact

For the `borrow()` function the deadline is not enforced for the period after which, once elapsed, the transaction is considered invalid and for the `repay()` function, the period in which a repayment must be made. The main area of concern is that at the current implementation the deadline parameter is not enforced and a result all transaction time frames are nullified. 

## Code Snippet
`modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        (_blockTimestamp() > deadline).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.TOO_OLD_TRANSACTION);
        _;
    }
`

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would recommend that the deadline input parameter be integrated into the borrowing or repayment data structures in storage in order to be verified against future transactions.
