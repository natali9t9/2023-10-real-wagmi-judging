# Use `unchecked` in `TickMath.sol` which is extensively used in `LiquidityManager.sol`
## Summary
Use `unchecked` in `TickMath.sol` which is extensively used in `LiquidityManager.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
The TickMath.sol library was taken from Uniswap. However, the original solidity version that was used was in this TickMath.sol library was < 0.8.0, Which means that the execution didn't revert when an overflow was reached. Now, `TickMath.sol` has used `0.8.4`, the arithmetic operations should be wrapped in an unchecked block. 

`getSqrtRatioAtTick()` has been extensively used in below `LiquidityManager.sol` functions,

1) `_getSingleSideRoundUpBorrowedAmount()`
2) `_restoreLiquidity()`
3) `_getHoldTokenAmountIn()`

The values returned from these functions wont be correct and the execution of these functions will be reverted when overflow occurs.

## Impact
`getSqrtRatioAtTick()` has been extensively used in `LiquidityManager.sol` functions, but the library `TickMath.sol` is compiled with pragma solidity `^0.8.4` which can be checked [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/vendor0.8/uniswap/TickMath.sol#L3) which doesn't allow for overflows, and since the function is not unchecked.

`getSqrtRatioAtTick()` used in `LiquidityManager.sol` will not behave as intended since it relies implicitly on overflows.

Uniswap v3 with version 0.8.0 `TickMath.sol` can be checked as below,
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/0.8/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol

and Current implementation of `TickMath.sol` used in wagmi contracts can be checked below,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/vendor0.8/uniswap/TickMath.sol

At first glance, if you can see both contracts are identical, but the `TickMath.sol` used in wagmi contracts will not let overflows happens, every time this function is used in the code it could revert and break the functionality.

```Solidity
File: wagmi-leverage/contracts/vendor0.8/uniswap/TickMath.sol

    function getSqrtRatioAtTick(int24 tick) internal pure returns (uint160 sqrtPriceX96) {         
        uint256 absTick = tick < 0 ? uint256(-int256(tick)) : uint256(int256(tick));    @audit // unchecked block is missing

        // EDIT: 0.8 compatibility
        require(absTick <= uint256(int256(MAX_TICK)), "T");


       // some code


        sqrtPriceX96 = uint160((ratio >> 32) + (ratio % (1 << 32) == 0 ? 0 : 1));
    }


    function getTickAtSqrtRatio(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) internal pure returns (int24 tick) {
        // second inequality must be < because the price can never reach the price at the max tick
        require(sqrtPriceX96 >= MIN_SQRT_RATIO && sqrtPriceX96 < MAX_SQRT_RATIO, "R");   @audit // unchecked block is missing

      
      // some code


        tick = tickLow == tickHi ? tickLow : getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickHi) <= sqrtPriceX96
            ? tickHi
            : tickLow;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is advised to put the entire function bodies of `getSqrtRatioAtTick()` and `getTickAtSqrtRatio()` in an unchecked block. A modified version of the original `TickMath` library that uses unchecked blocks to handle the overflow, can be found in the 0.8 branch of the [Uniswap v3-core repo](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/0.8/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol).
