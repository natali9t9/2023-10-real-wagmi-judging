## Summary
This issue,  highlights a security concern related to the use of the value 0 or 0x0 as a function argument. Such usage can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. The recommended approach is to replace these instances with descriptive constant variables to clarify their purpose and mitigate security risks.

## Vulnerability Detail
.
## Impact
Passing 0 or 0x0 as a function argument can sometimes result in a security issue.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
File: LiqBorrowingMan/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol

881:                     saleTokenBalance,

```

```solidity
File: LiqBorrowingMan/abstract/ApproveSwapAndPay.sol

95:                     require(_tryApprove(token, spender, 0));

```

```solidity
File: LiqBorrowingMan/libraries/ExternalCall.sol

27:             if gt(swapAmountInDataValue, 0) {

32:                 target,

35:                 data.length,

40:             if and(not(success), and(gt(returndatasize(), 0), lt(returndatasize(), 256))) {

41:                 returndatacopy(ptr, 0, returndatasize())

```

## Recommendation

Consider using a constant variable with a descriptive name, so it's clear that the argument is intentionally being used, and for the right reasons.
