# calling transferToken Function Disrupts Repay Functionality
## Summary

This report identifies a critical issue stemming from the improper implementation of the `transferToken` function. This flaw has the potential to disrupt the entire functionality of the `repay` function, rendering it impossible for users to repay their loans or for lenders to access the `repay` function during emergency scenarios.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `repay` function relies on the `transferToken` function to transfer assets and fees to different users, including borrowers, lenders, and liquidators. However, this implementation falls short of expectations. Consider the following snippet from the repay function

```solidity
function repay(
        RepayParams calldata params,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external nonReentrant checkDeadline(deadline) {
       ...
        // Check if it's an emergency repayment
        if (params.isEmergency) {
            (collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.FORBIDDEN);
            (
                uint256 removedAmt,
                uint256 feesAmt,
                bool completeRepayment
            ) = _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure(
                    zeroForSaleToken,
                    params.borrowingKey,
                    borrowing.feesOwed,
                    borrowing.borrowedAmount
                );
            (removedAmt == 0).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.LIQUIDITY_IS_ZERO);
            // prevent overspent
            // Subtract the removed amount and fees from borrowedAmount and feesOwed
            borrowing.borrowedAmount -= removedAmt;
            borrowing.feesOwed -= feesAmt;
            feesAmt /= Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
            // Deduct the removed amount from totalBorrowed
            holdTokenRateInfo.totalBorrowed -= removedAmt;
            // If loansInfoLength is 0, remove the borrowing key from storage and get the liquidation bonus
            if (completeRepayment) {
                LoanInfo[] memory empty;
                _removeKeysAndClearStorage(borrowing.borrower, params.borrowingKey, empty);
                feesAmt += liquidationBonus;
            } else {
                BorrowingInfo storage borrowingStorage = borrowingsInfo[params.borrowingKey];
                borrowingStorage.dailyRateCollateralBalance = 0;
                borrowingStorage.feesOwed = borrowing.feesOwed;
                borrowingStorage.borrowedAmount = borrowing.borrowedAmount;
                // Calculate the updated accLoanRatePerSeconds
                borrowingStorage.accLoanRatePerSeconds =
                    holdTokenRateInfo.accLoanRatePerSeconds -
                    FullMath.mulDiv(
                        uint256(-collateralBalance),
                        Constants.BP,
                        borrowing.borrowedAmount // new amount
                    );
            }
            // Transfer removedAmt + feesAmt to msg.sender and emit EmergencyLoanClosure event
            //@audit the transfer here will revert because of the onlyowner modifier
            Vault(VAULT_ADDRESS).transferToken(
                borrowing.holdToken,
                msg.sender,
                removedAmt + feesAmt
            );
            emit EmergencyLoanClosure(borrowing.borrower, msg.sender, params.borrowingKey);
        } else {
            // Deduct borrowedAmount from totalBorrowed
            holdTokenRateInfo.totalBorrowed -= borrowing.borrowedAmount;

            // Transfer the borrowed amount and liquidation bonus from the VAULT to this contract
            //@audit
            Vault(VAULT_ADDRESS).transferToken(
                borrowing.holdToken,
                address(this),
                borrowing.borrowedAmount + liquidationBonus
            );
            // Restore liquidity using the borrowed amount and pay a daily rate fee
            LoanInfo[] memory loans = loansInfo[params.borrowingKey];
            _maxApproveIfNecessary(
                borrowing.holdToken,
                address(underlyingPositionManager),
                type(uint128).max
            );
            _maxApproveIfNecessary(
                borrowing.saleToken,
                address(underlyingPositionManager),
                type(uint128).max
            );

           ...
        }
    }
```

The code shows that the `transferToken` function is called twice. However, the entire repay process is bound to fail because the `transferToken` function is only callable by the owner, enforced by the onlyOwner modifier:

```solidity
 function transferToken(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_amount > 0) {
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
    }
```

Due to this constraint, all calls to the repay function will fail, effectively preventing anyone from repaying their loans or liquidating their positions.

## Impact

The use of the onlyOwner modifier in the transferToken function has a severe impact as it disrupts the repay functionality. This can lead to a breakdown in the protocol's core operations, affecting both borrowers and lenders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

recommend removing the onlyOwner modifier from the `transferToken` function. Instead, create a custom modifier that allows calls from the protocol contracts and the owner only, maintaining security without disrupting the repay functionality
