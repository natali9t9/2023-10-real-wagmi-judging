# An attacker can increase liquidity to the position's UniswapNFT to prevent the loan from being repaid
## Summary
An attacker can increase liquidity to the position's UniswapNFT to prevent the loan from being repaid

## Vulnerability Detail
UniswapV3NPM allows the user to increase liquidity to any NFT.
```solidity
            function increaseLiquidity(IncreaseLiquidityParams calldata params)
                 external payable override checkDeadline(params.deadline)
                    returns (
                     uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
            {
            Position storage position = _positions[params.tokenId];
                PoolAddress.PoolKey memory poolKey = _poolIdToPoolKey[position.poolId];
                    IUniswapV3Pool pool;
                        (liquidity, amount0, amount1, pool) = addLiquidity(
```
_getHoldTokenAmountIn() function (which is called by restoreLiquidty()) uses getAmountsForLiquidity() to fetch amount0 and amount1. 
Later one of those values are used to calclulate holdTokenAmountIn
```solidity
461:     holdTokenAmountIn = amount0 == 0 ? 0 : holdTokenDebt - amount1;
```
An attacker can add liquidity and make amount1 bigger than holdTokenDebt. If this happens repay function will revert due to underflow

## Impact
Accidentally or intentionally, a lender can prevent a borrower from repaying their loan
