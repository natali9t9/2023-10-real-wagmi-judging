# The internal _upRestoreLiquidityCache function is a view function and does not return the supposed struct variable "cache."
## Summary
The internal `_upRestoreLiquidityCache` function does not return anything, and it is a view function. To ensure that the function `_restoreLiquidity` works as intended, the internal `_upRestoreLiquidityCache` function must return the `RestoreLiquidityCache memory cache` variable. This is necessary for the parent function to function correctly. Currently, these values default to Solidity's default type values, which is definitely not the intended behavior for this function.
## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the `_upRestoreLiquidityCache` function, there is an internal function call as follows:

Within this function, several variables are assigned values to populate the struct "cache," as demonstrated here:

However, since the "cache" struct is never returned to the parent function, all the variables that begin with "cache.variableName" default to Solidity's default type values.

As these values are not correctly returned, the function does not operate as intended. Consequently, all calculations within the parent function are inaccurate.
## Impact
This is definitely a major bug and needs to be corrected!

## Recommendation
Inside the `_upRestoreLiquidityCache` return the "cache" variable
