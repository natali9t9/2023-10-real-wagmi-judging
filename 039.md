# completeRepayment flag just checks loans.length == 0. But loans could be manipulated inside the loop
## Summary
The key issue is that loans is a storage array that can be manipulated inside the _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The completeRepayment flag just checks loans.length == 0. But loans could be manipulated inside the loop, so this can not be accurate

The key issue here is that loans is a storage array that can be manipulated inside the _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure function.
Specifically, this line is problematic:

         loans[i] = loans[loans.length - 1];
This replaces the loan at index `i` with the last loan in the array. Then `loans.pop()` is called to remove the last element.
The problem is that `loans.length` is not decremented when an element is replaced, so it remains the same even though an element was removed.
This means `completeRepayment = loans.length == 0 `  may not accurately reflect if all loans were removed or not.
For example:

     loans = [A, B, C]   // loans.length = 3

     Replace loan A with loan C
     loans = [C, B, C]

     Pop last element 
     loans = [C, B]  

     loans.length still equals 3 even though A was removed

So a malicious caller could remove loans but make it appear that loans still exist by manipulating the length in this way.

## Impact
This could allow attackers to steal funds, avoid repaying debts, or wrongly claim liquidation bonuses. The contract's accounting could become corrupted. In essence, it jeopardizes the integrity of the borrowing and repayment process. It could lead to loss of funds or improper accounting by the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
loans.length should be decremented whenever an element is removed:

     function _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure(...) {

       ...

       if (owner matches) {
         loans[i] = loans[loans.length - 1];
         loans.pop();
    
         // Decrement loans.length
         loans.length--;
  
       }

       ...

     }

Additionally, keeping a separate counter variable that tracks the number of loans removed would be more robust than relying on loans.length alone.
