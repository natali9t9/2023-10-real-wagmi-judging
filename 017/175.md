# Invalid caller bypass in LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol repay function
## Summary
In LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol any caller can bypass the borrower check in order to repay a loan and receive collateral and profits from the open position.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [`repay()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L532) function the check [`(msg.sender != borrowing.borrower && collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_CALLER
            );`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L559C13-L561C15) can be bypassed by any caller if the collateralBalance is less than zero.

## Impact

This could allow a caller to recieve holdToken and profits from the current open position by setting the emergency parameter to false or set it to true to force an emergancy loan closure.


## Code Snippet

(msg.sender != borrowing.borrower && collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_CALLER
  );


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would recommend the collateralBalance check be removed from this condition or for the logical and to be changed to a logical or.
