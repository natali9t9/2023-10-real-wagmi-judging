# The borrower may receive lower profits because of slippage
## Summary
The borrower may receive lower profits because of slippage.
## Vulnerability Detail
The _restoreLiquidity() function calculates the amount of hold tokens needed to swap for sale tokens. These tokens are used to [increase liquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L308) for loans.

```solidity
// Calculate the hold token amount to be used for swapping
            (uint256 holdTokenAmountIn, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = _getHoldTokenAmountIn(
                params.zeroForSaleToken,
                cache.tickLower,
                cache.tickUpper,
                cache.sqrtPriceX96,
                loan.liquidity,
                cache.holdTokenDebt
            ); 
```

The function uses a UniswapV2 pool to calculate the saleTokenAmountOut. 

```solidity
uint256 saleTokenAmountOut;
                (saleTokenAmountOut, cache.sqrtPriceX96, , ) = underlyingQuoterV2
                    .quoteExactInputSingle(
                        IQuoterV2.QuoteExactInputSingleParams({
                            tokenIn: cache.holdToken,
                            tokenOut: cache.saleToken,
                            amountIn: holdTokenAmountIn,
                            fee: params.fee,
                            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
                        })
                    ); 
```

And then it performs a v3 swap, using the saleTokenAmountOut as a slippage parameter.

```solidity
_v3SwapExactInput(
                        v3SwapExactInputParams({
                            fee: params.fee,
                            tokenIn: cache.holdToken,
                            tokenOut: cache.saleToken,
                            amountIn: holdTokenAmountIn,
                            amountOutMinimum: (saleTokenAmountOut * params.slippageBP1000) /
                                Constants.BPS
                        })
                    );
```
The issue is that a malicious attacker can manipulate the uniswapV2 pool in such a way that the saleTokenAmountOut would be lower than expected. This could result in executing the uniswapV3 swap or the external swap without any slippage protection, which can cause the user to receive fewer sale tokens than anticipated, leading to a loss in profit.

The function increaseLiquidity() will only [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L408-L425) if the amount of restored liquidity is less than the original loan liquidity amount. However, if the position is profitable, the loan can be restored without any issues. In such a case, the function won't be reverted.

After increasing liquidity, the remaining tokens should be [distributed to users as profit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L669-L670). However, due to the attacker's manipulation, It is possible that these profits could decrease or even be zero.
## Impact
The user may receive less or no profit due to the attacker.

## Recommendation
Don't use the saleTokenAmountOut as a slippage parameter.
