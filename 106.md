# Whitelisting Potentially Risky Swap Calls
## Summary:
The setSwapCallToWhitelist function could allow risky function selectors to be whitelisted.

## Vulnerability Detail:
The setSwapCallToWhitelist function, designed to add or remove swap calls to a whitelist, has restrictions on which addresses and function selectors can be added. Notably, it prohibits adding certain addresses like VAULT_ADDRESS, the current contract's address, and the underlyingPositionManager address. Similarly, it disallows the IERC20.transferFrom.selector.

However, the function doesn't prevent adding other potentially dangerous function selectors like approve and increaseAllowance. This could be exploited by an adversary, especially if the whitelisted call leads to unintended consequences when interacting with other contracts.

## Impact:
If a malicious or incorrect function selector is whitelisted, it may enable attacks or unexpected behaviors during swap operations. This could lead to loss of funds, unintended transfers, or manipulation of contract states.

## Code Snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L165C3-L175C6

`function setSwapCallToWhitelist(
    address swapTarget,
    bytes4 funcSelector,
    bool isAllowed
) external onlyOwner {
    (swapTarget == VAULT_ADDRESS ||
        swapTarget == address(this) ||
        swapTarget == address(underlyingPositionManager) ||
        funcSelector == IERC20.transferFrom.selector).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.FORBIDDEN);
    whitelistedCall[swapTarget][funcSelector] = isAllowed;
}`

## Tool used:
Manual Review

## Recommendation:
To enhance security and reduce potential risks:

1. Explicitly check and prohibit other potentially risky function selectors, including approve, increaseAllowance, and any other relevant selectors.
2. Consider creating a list of approved function selectors instead of using a blacklist approach. This way, only known-safe selectors can be whitelisted.
