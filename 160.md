# Governance functions should be controlled by time locks
### <a name="M-2"></a>[M-2] Governance functions should be controlled by time locks

#### Impact:
Governance functions (such as upgrading contracts, setting critical parameters) should be controlled using time locks to introduce a delay between a proposal and its execution. This gives users time to exit before a potentially dangerous or malicious operation is applied.

*Instances (3)*:
```solidity

184:     function collectProtocol(address recipient, address[] calldata tokens) external onlyOwner {

17:     function transferToken(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {

```

```solidity
