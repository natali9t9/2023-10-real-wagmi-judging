# Malicious lender can use blacklisted address and harm borrower
## Summary

If during the duration of a loan, the borrower got blacklisted by collateral asset contract, like USDC, there is no way to retrieve the collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol specifically mentions :

> Q: Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behaviour with the smart contracts?
> - Whatever uniswap v3 supports for their pools can interact with our contracts

Some tokens like USDC  have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

Malicious lender can use `repay()` function for this purpose. The lender can add the USDC blacklist to prevent the borrower from repaying the loan, and then withdraw the borrower's collateral.
## Impact

A malicious or compromised token lender can trap funds in a contract by adding the contract address to the blocklist.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Try to implement a try-catch solution where you skip certain funds whenever they cause the transfer to the blacklisted token address to revert.
