# `takeOverDebt` is not setting the new borrowing for the new borrowe/trader, resulting him paying funds without getting anything in return
## Summary

We have 2 users Bob and Alice, Bob borrows a borrowing, a borroing key is computed which is a result of `Keys.computeBorrowingKey(msg.sender, saleToken, holdToken)`. This key gets saved in `userBorrowingKeys(Bob)`. Bob's borrowing is now liquidatable, for whatever reason, Alice decides to take over Bob's debt, she calls `takeOverDebt` with the key of Bob's borrowing and the needed `collateralAmt` to take over the debt. The `takeOverDebt` function calculates the new borrowing and removed the old borrowing correctly, but fails to set it the new borrowing for alice as it is setting `_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);` instead of `_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, newBorrowingKey, oldLoans);`, this results `userBorrowingKeys(alice)` to be missing the new borrowing key, and `borrowingsInfo(newBorrowingKey)` to have `borrower` set to `address(0)` instead of `alice`. This results in Alice paying funds without getting anything in return.

## Vulnerability Detail

Adding the `borrowing` instead of the `newBorrowing` _addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans); instead of _addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, newBorrowingKey, oldLoans);

## Impact

The person who pays to `takeOverDebt` will pay money however, he will get nothing in return.

```solidity
 _addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, newBorrowingKey, oldLoans);` instead of `_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);`
