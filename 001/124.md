# The takeOverDebt uses the wrong borrowingKey
## Summary

The takeOverDebt should remove the old borrowingKey and add a new borrowingKey, but the code implementation is wrong and the added borrowingKey is still old.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        // Retrieve the old loans associated with the borrowing key and remove them from storage
        LoanInfo[] memory oldLoans = loansInfo[borrowingKey];
        _removeKeysAndClearStorage(oldBorrowing.borrower, borrowingKey, oldLoans);
        // Initialize a new borrowing using the same saleToken, holdToken
        (
            uint256 feesDebt,
            bytes32 newBorrowingKey,
            BorrowingInfo storage newBorrowing
        ) = _initOrUpdateBorrowing(
                oldBorrowing.saleToken,
                oldBorrowing.holdToken,
                accLoanRatePerSeconds
            );
        // Add the new borrowing key and old loans to the newBorrowing
        // @audit using the wrong borrowingKey
        _addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);
```

- The wrong borrowingKey caused the new user to use the loanInfo corresponding to the previous user's borrowingKey, causing confusion in the internal accounting system.
- When the user borrows again, _initOrUpdateBorrowing will consider that is an init state, and a new state will be created based on newBorrowingKey instead of updating the borrowingKey.

## Impact

Wrong borrowingKey caused confusion in the internal accounting system and affected user funds
