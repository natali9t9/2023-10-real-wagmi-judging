# key is not updated during the transfer of the ownership of a borrowing via takeOverDebt() function
## Summary
The `update bool` will be false when  _addKeysAndLoansInfo() is called within takeOverDebt() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
during the transfer of the ownership of a borrowing, the tokenIds are supposed to be updated with the new key (i.e, tokenIdLoansKeys[] in `tokenIdToBorrowingKeys` is supposed to be updated with the new key).

But this won't happen since update bool will be false. And this is due to newBorrowing.borrowedAmount being 0, since it was not updated with oldBorrowing.borrowedAmount.

For update bool to be true newBorrowing.borrowedAmount has to be > 0
```solidity
 _addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans)
```

## Impact
1. tokenIdLoansKeys[] in `tokenIdToBorrowingKeys` won't be updated with new Key during the transfer of the ownership of a borrowing via the takeOverDebt()

2. It won't be possible to retrieve borrowing information for a specific NonfungiblePositionManager tokenId via getLenderCreditsInfo()

## Recommendation
update the newBorrowing.borrowedAmount with oldBorrowing.borrowedAmount before the call to _addKeysAndLoansInfo() in the takeOverDebt() function
