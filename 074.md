# Users cannot swap token1 for token0
## Summary
The function only helps pay for amount0delta(token0) swaps. It does not help a user pay or rather find the change in token1 balance resulting from the swap.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function reverts if the amount entered is smaller or equals to 0 for amount0Delta and amount1Delta L247. The probelm is when in order to make payments(swap) for amount1Delta(token1) the amount for amount0Delta must be smaller than 0 in the below code snippet
## Impact
A user can only swap for token0 and not token1
## Code Snippet
        uint256 amountToPay = amount0Delta > 0 ? uint256(amount0Delta) : uint256(amount1Delta);
        _pay(tokenIn, address(this), msg.sender, amountToPay);
