## Recommendation

LiquidityManager, the functions use UniswapV3.slot0 to get the value of sqrtPriceX96, which is used to perform the swap. However, the sqrtPriceX96 is pulled from Uniswap.slot0, which is the most recent data point and can be manipulated easily via MEV bots and Flashloans with sandwich attacks; which can cause the loss of funds when interacting with Uniswap.swap function.

IMPACT: HIGH
