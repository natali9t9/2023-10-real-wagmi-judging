# Use of slot0 to get sqrtPriceLimitX96 can lead to price manipulation.
## Summary
Use of slot0 to get sqrtPriceLimitX96 can lead to price manipulation.
## Vulnerability Detail
In LiquidityManager.sol, _getCurrentSqrtPriceX96() use UniswapV3.slot0 to get the value of sqrtPriceX96.
However, the sqrtPriceX96 is pulled from Uniswap.slot0, which is the most recent data point and can be manipulated easily via MEV bots and Flashloans with sandwich attacks.
