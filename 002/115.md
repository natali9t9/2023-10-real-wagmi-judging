# Usage of slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate
## Summary

Protocol use `slot0()` in price calculation, which is easy to manipulate.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol use `IUniswapV3Pool(poolAddress).slot0();` to get current sqrt price and use this value to calculate the amounts of token0 and token1 for a given liquidity when [restore liquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L290-L302), called when users repay.

However, the `sqrtPriceX96` is get from `IUniswapV3Pool(poolAddress).slot0();`, which is easy to manipulate.

## Impact

Pool lp value can be manipulated and cause other users to receive less lp tokens, or malicious users can steal funds by repay less liquidity to protocol by manipulating `slot0`.

## Tool used

vscode, Manual Review

## Recommendation

To make any calculation use a uniswap TWAP instead of slot0.
