# Using `slot0` for `sqrtPriceX96` in order to calculate amount could lead to price manipulation
## Summary
Using `slot0` for `sqrtPriceX96` in order to calculate amount could lead to price manipulation

## Vulnerability Detail
`_getCurrentSqrtPriceX96()` function retrieves the slot0 data of the Uniswap V3 pool using

```Solidity
        address poolAddress = computePoolAddress(tokenA, tokenB, fee);
        (sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(poolAddress).slot0();
```

The slot0 function returns various parameters of the pool, including the sqrtPriceX96 value and `slot0` is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate. More info on slot0 can be checked [here](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0)

`_getCurrentSqrtPriceX96()` has been used in below functions,

1) `_restoreLiquidity()`
2) `_upRestoreLiquidityCache()`

## Impact
tokens value can be manipulated to cause loss of funds for the protocol and other users via flash loans, MEV searchers etc. This allows a malicious user to manipulate the valuation of the LP. An example of this kind of manipulation would be to use large buys/sells to alter the composition of the LP to make it worth less or more. A big swap using a flash loan can push the liquidity to one side only.
