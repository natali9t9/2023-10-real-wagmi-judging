# Rollup address aliasing blocks users from repaying/topping up during sequencer downtime
## Summary

Arbitrum and other popular rollups [alias addresses](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) when conducting L1 -> L2 transactions. These type of transactions are essential when trying to complete an L2 transaction when the sequencer is down. Due the borrower restriction on both increaseCollateralBalance and repay it is impossible to do either if the sequencer goes down. On the other hand the user can still be liquidated by anyone else, causing unfair loss to the user. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L559-L561](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L559-L561)

            (msg.sender != borrowing.borrower && collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_CALLER
            );

First we consider repay. This will revert if msg.sender is not the borrower and the collateralBalance is positive. In the event of sequencer downtime, their address will be aliased and the transaction will revert if they are still solvent.

[LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L371-L376](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L371-L376)

    function increaseCollateralBalance(bytes32 borrowingKey, uint256 collateralAmt) external {
        BorrowingInfo storage borrowing = borrowingsInfo[borrowingKey];
        // Ensure that the borrowed position exists and the borrower is the message sender
        (borrowing.borrowedAmount == 0 || borrowing.borrower != address(msg.sender)).revertError(
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_BORROWING_KEY
        );

Next we look at increaseCollateralBalance. This has the exact same issue, blocking the user from either topping up their position or safely exiting their position. Once their collateral is used up, they will be unfairly liquidated causing loss to the borrower.

## Impact

During sequencer downtime, borrowers will be unfairly liquidated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When checking msg.sender in increaseCollateralBalance and repay, check both borrower and aliased borrower address. This allows borrowers to always increase their collateral or repay their loan even when the sequencer is down and their address is aliased.
