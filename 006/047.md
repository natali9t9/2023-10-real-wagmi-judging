# Borrower cannot `repay()` if lender burns its NFT
## Summary

Lenders approve their Uniswapv3 NFTs on the wagmi contract. When borrowers [`borrow()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L465) liquidity to long an asset, the NFT position's liquidity is decreased.

Later when the borrower wants to [`repay()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L532) its loan, the tokens he borrowed are added back to the liquidity position. But if the liquidity position doesn't exist anymore then the call will revert not allowing borrowers to close their positions.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [`repay()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L532C7-L532C7) function of the LiquidityBorrowingManager contract, we try to recreate the liquidity position of the lenders.

This happens in the [`_restoreLiquidity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/b33752757fd6a9f404b8577c1eae6c5774b3a0db/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L650) function, where we pass all the loans that belong to the borrowing position.

There for each loan the function queries the NonfungiblePositionManager contract with the `tokenId` to get all the infos of the position and then will try to [`increaseLiquidity()`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L198).

But if one of the loan position was burned by the lender after being borrowed, the call to the NonfungiblePositionManager will revert [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L100) as the `tokenId` doesn't exist anymore.

Consider this POC that can be copied and pasted in the test files (replace all tests and just keep the setup & NFT creation):

```js
it("LEFT_OUTRANGE_TOKEN_1 borrowing liquidity (long position WBTC zeroForSaleToken = false)  will be successful", async () => {
        //create the borrowing position
        const amountWBTC = ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.05", 8); //token0
        const deadline = (await time.latest()) + 60;
        const minLeverageDesired = 50;
        const maxCollateralWBTC = amountWBTC.div(minLeverageDesired);

        const loans = [
            {
                liquidity: nftpos[3].liquidity,
                tokenId: nftpos[3].tokenId,
            },
        ];

        const swapParams: ApproveSwapAndPay.SwapParamsStruct = {
            swapTarget: constants.AddressZero,
            swapAmountInDataIndex: 0,
            maxGasForCall: 0,
            swapData: swapData,
        };

        let params: LiquidityBorrowingManager.BorrowParamsStruct = {
            internalSwapPoolfee: 500,
            saleToken: WETH_ADDRESS,
            holdToken: WBTC_ADDRESS,
            minHoldTokenOut: amountWBTC.mul(2), //<=TooLittleReceivedError
            maxCollateral: maxCollateralWBTC,
            externalSwap: swapParams,
            loans: loans,
        };

        await expect(borrowingManager.connect(bob).borrow(params, deadline)).to.be.reverted;

        params = {
            internalSwapPoolfee: 500,
            saleToken: WETH_ADDRESS,
            holdToken: WBTC_ADDRESS,
            minHoldTokenOut: amountWBTC,
            maxCollateral: maxCollateralWBTC,
            externalSwap: swapParams,
            loans: loans,
        };

        await borrowingManager.connect(bob).borrow(params, deadline);

        //Alice burns her NFT
        nonfungiblePositionManager.connect(alice).burn(nftpos[3].tokenId);
    });

    it("repay borrowing and restore liquidity (long position WBTC zeroForSaleToken = false) will be unsuccessful because NFT burned", async () => {
        const borrowingKey = await borrowingManager.userBorrowingKeys(bob.address, 0);
        const deadline = (await time.latest()) + 60;
        const swapParams: ApproveSwapAndPay.SwapParamsStruct = {
            swapTarget: constants.AddressZero,
            swapAmountInDataIndex: 0,
            maxGasForCall: 0,
            swapData: swapData,
        };
        let params = {
            isEmergency: false,
            internalSwapPoolfee: 500,
            externalSwap: swapParams,
            borrowingKey: borrowingKey,
            swapSlippageBP1000: 990, //1%
        };

        //BOB cannot repay his loan and loose his liquidation bonus and potential profits
        await expect(borrowingManager.connect(bob).repay(params, deadline)).to.be.revertedWith("Invalid token ID");
    });
```

## Impact

High. 

- Borrower will not be able to close its position, loosing his liquidation bonus and potential profits.
- Position cannot be liquidated by liquidators/bots.
- Since borrower will stop paying fees, lenders that didn't go rogue will not be earning anymore until they monitor their position and find out that they need to do an emergency liquidity restoration.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a vault/router contract that will hold the NFT positions so lenders cannot burn their positions.
