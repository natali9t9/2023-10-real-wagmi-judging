# LiquidityManager.sol - usage of ``slot0`` is a bad practice
## Summary
The ``LiquidityManager`` abstract contract introduces possible operations with liquidity such as adding, removing, extracting and restoring liquidity. It uses a cache variable to store various elements such as the ``sqrtPricex96``, which checks the spot price of the univ3 pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``slot0`` or spot price has been historically proven to be a bad practice since it is easily manipulatable and core operations regarding liquidity in this codebase rely on that spot price. Large intentional trades can cause unfair price movement via front-running to shift the spot price of underlying pair assets and mess up the token amounts calculation 

## Impact
Wrong liquidity calculation, potential use losses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To make any calculation use a TWAP instead of slot0.
