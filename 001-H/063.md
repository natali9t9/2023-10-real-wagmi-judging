# Attacker can manipulate low TVL Uniswap V3 pool to swap to make user in loss
## Summary
Uniswap V3 can have multiple pools for the same pairs of ERC20 tokens with different fee params,positions in low-liquidity pools may lead to losses for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Uniswap V3 can have multiple pools for the same pairs of ERC20 tokens with different fee params. A fews has most the liquidity, while other pools have extremely little TVL or even not created yet. Attackers can abuse it, create low TVL pool where liquidity in this pool mostly (or fully) belong to attacker’s position, malicious actors can offer their positions to borrowers for lending. Borrowers then perform swaps and liquidity additions within the pool, potentially resulting in capital losses.


## Impact
Users may incur losses.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a whitelist that only allows positions from pools with a sufficient Total Value Locked (TVL) to be part of the protocol
