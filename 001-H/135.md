# Use of `slot0` to get `sqrtPriceLimitX96` can lead to price manipulation
## Summary
Using slot0 to obtain sqrtPriceLimitX96 can prevent users from repaying their loans.

## Vulnerability Detail
However, the sqrtPriceX96 is pulled from Uniswap.slot0, which is the most recent data point and can be manipulated easily via MEV bots and Flashloans.
```solidity
function _getCurrentSqrtPriceX96(
        bool zeroForA,
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint24 fee
    ) private view returns (uint160 sqrtPriceX96) {
        if (!zeroForA) {
            (tokenA, tokenB) = (tokenB, tokenA);
        }
        address poolAddress = computePoolAddress(tokenA, tokenB, fee);
        (sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(poolAddress).slot0();
    }
```
sqrtPriceX96 is used within _getHoldTokenAmountIn() and getAmountsForLiquidity(). Both are part of restoreLiquidity() function.
Wrong amounts may be retrieved and used in _increaseLiquidity(), resulting in the restoration of the wrong amount of liquidity. If this is the case, the repay() function will revert due to this check:
```solidity
410: if (restoredLiquidity < loan.liquidity) {
```

## Impact
Users may become unable to repay their loans.

## Recommendation
Use a TWAP instead of slot0.
