# Liquidation bonus can be stolen through repay() as the fund is not returned to original borrower when a new borrower calls takeOverDebt()
## Summary

Liquidation bonus from the original borrower will not be returned when his borrowed position is being taken over. The new user can steal the liquidation bonus from the original borrower by taking over his debt and calling `repay()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user borrows a position, he calls `borrow()`, and has to pay a small liquidationBonus (which is set at 0.69%). 

```solidity
        _pay(
            params.holdToken,
            msg.sender,
            VAULT_ADDRESS,
            borrowingCollateral + liquidationBonus + cache.dailyRateCollateral + feesDebt
        );
```

This percentage is calculated against the total borrowed amount, so if the user borrows 10000 USDT, he has to pay 0.69% of 10000 which is 69 USDT.

When another borrower calls `takeOverDebt()`, he tops up the collateralAmt and feesDebt but does not pay any liquidation bonus. The original borrower also does not get back his liquidation bonus.

```solidity
        //newBorrowing.accLoanRatePerSeconds = oldBorrowing.accLoanRatePerSeconds;
        _pay(oldBorrowing.holdToken, msg.sender, VAULT_ADDRESS, collateralAmt + feesDebt);
```

When calling `repay()`, the function checks that the msg.sender == borrower. The `repay()` function will then transfer the liquidation bonus from the vault account to the LiquidityBorrowingManager contract. The funds will subsequently be transferred to the borrower.

```solidity
            (msg.sender != borrowing.borrower && collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_CALLER
            );
```

A new borrower can take over an original borrower's position, and then call `repay()` to clear off his position. He will receive the liquidation bonus, effectively stealing it from the original borrower

## Impact

Old borrowers cannot receive their liquidation bonus back. The new borrower can steal the liquidation bonus by calling repay after taking over the borrowed position

## Recommendation

Recommend repaying the original borrower his liquidation bonus back since his position is not liquidated, but rather taken over. The borrower who takes over the position should also take over the payment of liquidation bonus.
