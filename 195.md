# If loan is not liquidated in time, underflow may prevent loan from being liquidated using emergency mode
## Summary
If roughly 500_000 seconds (~5 days) has passed and loan is not liquidated, emergency repayment will fail due to underflow causing repay function to revert

## Vulnerability Detail

borrowingStorage.accLoanRatePerSeconds =
                    holdTokenRateInfo.accLoanRatePerSeconds -
                    FullMath.mulDiv(
                        uint256(-collateralBalance),
                        Constants.BP,
                        borrowing.borrowedAmount // new amount
                    );

When `collateralBalance` grows large enough, this part of the `repay` function will revert

## POC
In line 421 of `WagmiLeverageTests.ts`, if time is increased to 500_000, the next test that repays will fail with Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block.

## Impact
Prevention of liquidity providers from recovering their funds from a loan under liquidation. May also have impact on regular liquidation but did not have time to check due submission close to end of contest

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle possible underflow with additional checks before the calculation
