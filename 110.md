# Exessive Round up of Collateral
## Summary

`COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION`, which is `1e18` can cause signifcant rounding error when calculating `collateralAmt`

## Vulnerability Detail

COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION is 18 decimals. The rounding up is excessive as everySecond and lifetimeInSeconds do not have significant scaling

```solidity

collateralAmt = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(

everySecond,

lifetimeInSeconds,

Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION

);
```

## Impact

Calculation is incorrect when decimals is `18`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Multiply by a scaling factor before dividing by a `COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION ` and scale down afterwards
