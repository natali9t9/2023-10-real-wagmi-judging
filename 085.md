# Protocol is incompatible with ZkSync Era due to differences in address deviation
## Summary

ZkSync utilizes a different prefix than most other EVM based chains. Instead of using "ff" it uses [zksynceCreate2](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#address-derivation). This causes `computePoolAddress` to return incorrect pool addresses. Due to this the protocol will be broken when deployed there.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

## Impact

Contracts are nonfunctional on ZkSync

## Recommendation

Rewrite `computePoolAddress` account for this difference.
