# Any position can be taken over immediately
## Summary

If a new borrower knows the borrowing key of the original borrower, he can take over the borrowed position anytime

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating a new borrowing position, a borrowing key is created using the address of the borrower, the saleToken and the holdToken.

```solidity
    function _initOrUpdateBorrowing(
        address saleToken,
        address holdToken,
        uint256 accLoanRatePerSeconds
    ) private returns (uint256 feesDebt, bytes32 borrowingKey, BorrowingInfo storage borrowing) {
        // Compute the borrowingKey using the msg.sender, saleToken, and holdToken
->      borrowingKey = Keys.computeBorrowingKey(msg.sender, saleToken, holdToken);
```

When `takingOverDebt()`, the new borrower just has to top up the collateral amount and pay any fees due and he will take over the position of the original borrower. 

Unless the condition for taking over the position is for the new borrowers to pay more platform fees, this seems like a griefing attack to original borrowers as new users can just take over anyone's loan.

## Impact

Griefing attack towards the original borrowers. The original borrowers will lose their liquidation bonus as well.

## Recommendation

Have certain conditions for users to take over the original borrower, for example having a fixed deadline (maybe 10 hours after a new borrow position is created can a new borrower then take over his position )
