# Solidity version not run in all chains
## Summary

The Solidity version 0.8.21 includes the push0 instruction, which is not supported in some chains, such as [[Arbitrum](https://docs.arbitrum.io/solidity-support)](https://docs.arbitrum.io/solidity-support).

## Vulnerability Detail

In newer versions of Solidity, the push0 instruction is included. However, some chains do not support this instruction. The Real Wagmi should be deployed on multiple chains. However, some of them do not support the push0 instruction. This means that the contract will be deployed but will not be executed.

## Impact

Code deployed in not supported chains will not execute.
