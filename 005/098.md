# The used solidity version 0.8.21 will not work properly on Arbitrum
## Summary
The pragma is configured for version 0.8.21, it means that contracts require the compiler to be exactly version 0.8.21. The contest description states that the protocol is to be deployed on Arbitrum. However, this poses an issue since [Arbitrum doesn't work with versions 0.8.20 or later](https://docs.arbitrum.io/solidity-support). Compiling contracts for Arbitrum could result in faulty code. 

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary

## Impact
Damaged or non functional protocol if deployed on Arbitrum

## Code Snippet
All contracts of the protocol:

```bash

grep -Rl "pragma solidity 0.8.21;" ./contracts/
./contracts/mock/AggregatorMock.sol
./contracts/interfaces/IVault.sol
./contracts/interfaces/INonfungiblePositionManager.sol
./contracts/interfaces/IQuoterV2.sol
./contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol
./contracts/Vault.sol
./contracts/libraries/Keys.sol
./contracts/libraries/Constants.sol
./contracts/libraries/ExternalCall.sol
./contracts/libraries/ErrLib.sol
./contracts/abstract/ApproveSwapAndPay.sol
./contracts/abstract/OwnerSettings.sol
./contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol
./contracts/abstract/DailyRateAndCollateral.sol
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use pragma such as 
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <=0.8.19;
```
