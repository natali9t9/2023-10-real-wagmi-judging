# The fees are always rounded up in _calculateCollateralBalance(), which benefits the protocol over the user
## Summary
Rounding fees up benefits the protocol at the cost of users paying slightly higher fees. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The code in _calculateCollateralBalance() does round up fees in a way that benefits the protocol over the user.
The key lines are:

     currentFees = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
         borrowedAmount, 
         accLoanRatePerSeconds - borrowingAccLoanRatePerShare,
         Constants.BP
     );
This uses FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp() to calculate the fees. As the name suggests, this rounds the result up to the nearest integer.
Normally in division, remainders are rounded down. But here, rounding up ensures any remainder is added to the fees. This increases the fees collected by the protocol.
For example, if the actual fee calculation resulted in a value like 100.000001, rounding down would give fees of 100. But rounding up makes it 101.
Over many transactions, these small roundings add up to significant extra fees for the protocol. The user pays more fees than they should based on the exact calculation. 

## Impact
Users pay slightly higher fees, reducing their collateral balance.

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
This could be mitigated by using standard rounding instead of always rounding up:

     currentFees = FullMath.mulDiv(
         borrowedAmount, 
         accLoanRatePerSeconds - borrowingAccLoanRatePerShare,
         Constants.BP
     );

Now remainders are rounded to the nearest integer, rather than always up. This removes the bias and calculates fees fairly.
