# Incomplete Token Transfer in Emergency Loan Closure
## Summary
During the emergency loan closure process, the function might not handle the transfer of borrowing.saleToken to the caller, potentially leaving assets behind.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the repay function, during the emergency loan closure, the system is set to transfer the borrowing.holdToken and the related fees to the caller using the Vault(VAULT_ADDRESS).transferToken function. However, there is no evident logic to handle the transfer of the borrowing.saleToken.

If the intention was to transfer both the borrowing.holdToken and the borrowing.saleToken during the emergency closure, this could mean the borrowing.saleToken would stay within the contract and not be accessible to the caller, thus leading to potential fund lockup.

## Impact
1. Users may not be able to retrieve their full expected value during emergency loan closures.
2. The protocol could unintentionally hold tokens that should have been returned to users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the transfer mechanism handles all relevant tokens (both borrowing.holdToken and borrowing.saleToken) as intended.
Review the function logic to determine whether there are other areas where tokens might be left unhandled, and implement appropriate transfer or handling procedures.
