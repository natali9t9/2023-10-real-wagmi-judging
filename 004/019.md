# Slippage loss because `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` are set to zero
## Summary
Setting `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` for increasing and adding liquidity can result in loss of funds due to sandwich attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
`amount0Min` and `amount1Min` are set to zero in the links below which indicates that the user is okay with 100% slippage loss. The only check done afterwards is to check that amount received are not zero which can be bypassed by allowing user receive just tiny amount of asset.

```solidity
 INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0, //@audit sliipage loss. 
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp//@audit deadline.
            })
```
```solidity
 INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: loan.tokenId,
                amount0Desired: amount0,
                amount1Desired: amount1,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,//@audit slippage loss
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
```
## Impact
Loss of fund due to slippage

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: loan.tokenId,
                amount0Desired: amount0,
                amount1Desired: amount1,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,//@audit slippage loss
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` to be passed as input parameter offchain.
