# No slippage and deadline check when decreasing liquidity
## Summary

There is no slippage and deadline check when decreasing the liquidity of a given position

## Vulnerability Detail

When a borrower calls `borrow()`, `_precalculateBorrowing()` is called which calls `_extractLiquidity()`. `_extractLiquidity()` calls `_decreaseLiquidity()`, which calls `decreaseLiquidity` in the nonFungiblePositionManager of Uniswapv3.

```solidity
File: LiquidityManager.sol
349:     function _decreaseLiquidity(uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity) private {
350:         // Call the decreaseLiquidity function of underlyingPositionManager contract
351:         // with DecreaseLiquidityParams struct as argument
352:         (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = underlyingPositionManager.decreaseLiquidity(
353:             INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
354:                 tokenId: tokenId,
355:                 liquidity: liquidity,
356:                 amount0Min: 0, //@audit no minOut
357:                 amount1Min: 0, 
358:                 deadline: block.timestamp //@audit no deadline check
359:             })
360:         );
```

There is no check for slippage or deadline when decreasing the liquidity. The uniswapV3 Docs mentions that 

> amount0Min and amount1Min should be adjusted to create slippage protection.

There are also other places where slippage and deadline are not checked, such as increasing liquidity and underlyingQuoterV2.quoteExactInputSingle, where sqrtPriceLimitX96 is 0.

## Impact

No slippage or deadline check leads to undesired swapping outcome
