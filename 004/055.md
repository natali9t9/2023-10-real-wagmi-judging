# LiquidityManager.sol _increaseLiquidity() lacks slippage protection
## Summary
LiquidityManager.sol _increaseLiquidity() lacks slippage protection 
## Vulnerability Detail
In below instances, a call to Uniswap V3 is made. Calls amount0Min and amount1Min are each set to 0, which allows for a 100% slippage tolerance. This means, that the action could lead to the caller losing up to 100% of their tokens due to slippage.

## Impact
There is no slippage protection on any of the calls to increase or decrease liquidity, allowing for trades to be subject to MEV-style attacks such as front-running and sandwiching.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow the caller to specify values for amount0Min and amount1Min instead of setting them to 0.
