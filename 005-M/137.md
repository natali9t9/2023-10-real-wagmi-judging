# Users may lose their funds
## Summary
Users may lose funds

## Vulnerability Detail
RealWagmi going to be deployed on following chains:
Mainnet, KavaEVM,Arbitrum, polygon, zkera, optimism,fantom opera, avalanche,base,linea,bs

The problem is that Uniswap doesn't support kavaevm, zkera, fantom, linea. If contracts will be deployed on those chains wrong address of Uniswap contracts will be used
```solidity
constructor(
        address _underlyingPositionManagerAddress,
        address _underlyingQuoterV2,
        address _underlyingV3Factory,
        bytes32 _underlyingV3PoolInitCodeHash
    ) ApproveSwapAndPay(_underlyingV3Factory, _underlyingV3PoolInitCodeHash) {
        // Assign the underlying position manager contract address
        underlyingPositionManager = INonfungiblePositionManager(_underlyingPositionManagerAddress);
        // Assign the underlying quoterV2 contract address
        underlyingQuoterV2 = IQuoterV2(_underlyingQuoterV2);
        // Generate a unique salt for the new Vault contract
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(block.timestamp, address(this)));
        // Deploy a new Vault contract using the generated salt and assign its address to VAULT_ADDRESS
        VAULT_ADDRESS = address(new Vault{ salt: salt }());
    }
```
If users will try to interact with RealWagmi contracts on unsupported chains they most likely loose their funds

## Impact
Users may lose their funds when interacting with RealWagmi contracts on unsupported chains.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before deploying RealWagmi contracts on a particular chain, ensure that Uniswap contracts are supported on that chain
