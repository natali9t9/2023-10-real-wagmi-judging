# Some chains do not support the solidity shanghai fork version
## Summary

Solidity >= 0.8.20 version introduces push0 instruction, which is still not supported by many chains, like [Arbitrum](https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support#Differences%20from%20Solidity%20on%20Ethereum) and might be problematic for projects compiled.    

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.21;
```

Real Wagmi is compiled using the latest solidity version, which may cause problems on the L2 chain.
This could also become a problem if different versions of Solidity are used to compile contracts for different chains. The differences in bytecode between versions can impact the deterministic nature of contract addresses, potentially breaking counterfactuality.     

## Impact

1. The contract may not compile/run properly
2. Compiling with different versions of solidity may result in different contract addresses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the Solidity compiler version to 0.8.19
