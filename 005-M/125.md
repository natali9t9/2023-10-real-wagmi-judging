# Project may fail to be deployed to arbitrum chains becoz of `PUSH0` opcode
## Summary
The protocol is expected to be functional on many  EVM chain and one of the chain is Arbitrum. 
`PUSH0` is an instruction which pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack. This opcode is still not supported by many chains, like [Arbitrum](https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support#Differences%20from%20Solidity%20on%20Ethereum) and might be problematic for projects compiled with a version of Solidity <=0.8.20

## Vulnerability Detail
I did just find a reference: [https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support]( https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support)

## Impact
Contracts may become completely non-functional on arbitrum chains.
