# Malicious users can  avoid liquidation penalties by setting the liquidation bonus to 0
## Summary
The liquidation bonus calculations make assumptions about default values if no bonus is set. An attacker could set the bonus to 0 to avoid penalties. 
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could manipulate the liquidation bonus calculation to avoid penalties by setting the bonus to 0. Here is an explanation:

The getLiquidationBonus function first retrieves the Liquidation struct for the given token:

      Liquidation memory liq = liquidationBonusForToken[token];
It then checks if the bonusBP field is 0:

      if (liq.bonusBP == 0) {
        // use default bonus  
      }
If bonusBP is 0, it will use the default bonus defined in the Constants contract instead of applying a token-specific bonus.
An attacker could exploit this by:
1.	Calling setLiquidationBonus as the owner to set bonusBP to 0 for a token:

            setLiquidationBonus(token, 0, 0);

3.	Borrowing that token.
4.	Defaulting on the loan.

When the loan is liquidated, getLiquidationBonus will be called and use the default bonus instead of applying a higher token-specific bonus. This allows the attacker to avoid the intended larger liquidation penalty

## Impact
Attackers could borrow assets without being penalized for defaulting. This makes lending riskier and less viable, and exposes lenders to potential exploitation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
getLiquidationBonus could be changed to enforce a minimum bonus percentage if the token-specific bonus is 0:

      function getLiquidationBonus(
              address token,
              uint256 borrowedAmount,
              uint256 times
          ) public view returns (uint256 liquidationBonus) {

        Liquidation memory liq = liquidationBonusForToken[token];

        if (liq.bonusBP == 0) {
          // Enforce minimum bonus
          liq.bonusBP = MINIMUM_BONUS_BP; 
        }

        // Rest of function
      }

This would prevent attackers from avoiding liquidation penalties by setting the bonus to 0.
