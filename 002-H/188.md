# the function takeoverDebt doesn't properly update the liquidator balance
## Summary
the function takeoverdebt doesn't not properly update the liquidator balance which might lead to fund loss 
## Vulnerability Detail
the function **takeoverdebt** is used to liquidate another borrower and transfer the position into the liquidator and when transferring the loan[] using` _addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);` it is using the liquidated **borrowingkey** instead of the new one so the loan will will be updated into the previous one so when repaying using the repay function it might not use all the position
## Impact
loss of fund
