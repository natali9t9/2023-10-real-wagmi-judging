# In `takeOverDebt`, wrong parameter `borrowingKey` is used to call `_addKeysAndLoansInfo`
## Summary

In `takeOverDebt`, wrong parameter `borrowingKey` is used to call `_addKeysAndLoansInfo`

## Vulnerability Detail

The original purpose of the function `takeOverDebt` is taking over debt by transferring ownership of a borrowing to the current caller. So it uses `_addKeysAndLoansInfo` to add the oldLoans to the new caller. However, it uses wrong parameter `borrowingKey` which is the old borrowingkey.

## Impact

New caller loses the loans.
