# Whenever a user wants to `takeOverDebt` will never work
## Summary
In `LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol` a user can `takeOverDebt` for a specific borrower by providing the borrower's `borrowingKey`: 

```solidity
function takeOverDebt(bytes32 borrowingKey, uint256 collateralAmt)
```

## Vulnerability Detail

In order for a user to successfully take over a borrower's debt, he has to provide : 

```solidity
(collateralAmt <= minPayment).revertError(
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.COLLATERAL_AMOUNT_IS_NOT_ENOUGH
            );
```

`collateralAmt` is the amount of collateral to be provided by the new borrower.
`minPayment` is the minimum payment required based on the collateral balance for the old borrower.

Then loans and keys are removed from the old borrower

```solidity
_removeKeysAndClearStorage(oldBorrowing.borrower, borrowingKey, oldLoans);
```

After that the
 ```solidity
(uint256 feesDebt, bytes32 newBorrowingKey, BorrowingInfo storage newBorrowing) = _initOrUpdateBorrowing(
                oldBorrowing.saleToken,
                oldBorrowing.holdToken,
                accLoanRatePerSeconds
            );
```
is called which returns the msg.sender's (new borrower) `bytes32 newBorrowingKey` then:

```solidity
// Add the new borrowing key and old loans to the newBorrowing
_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);
```

The problem is that the old loans and the initialization of the borrower are added again to the **OLD** borrower because `borrowingKey` is used in `_addKeysAndLoansInfo` rather than the new borrower's `newBorrowingKey`.


## Impact

User can't take over another borrower's debt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

**--** `_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, borrowingKey, oldLoans);`
**++** `_addKeysAndLoansInfo(newBorrowing.borrowedAmount > 0, newBorrowingKey, oldLoans);`
