# Low decimal tokens such as EURS will not work as dailyRateCollateral will be overinflated
## Summary

Some tokens have an extremely low amount of decimals, like EURS which has 2 decimals. When calculating `dailyRateCollateral`, low decimal tokens will result in overinflated payments.

## Vulnerability Detail

`dailyRateCollateral` is calculated by first calling `_updateTokenRateInfo` and setting the `currentDailyRate`. If  there is no set amount, the `currentDailyRate` will be set to 10, which is the `DEFAULT_DAILY_RATE`. Once `currentDailyRate` is set, the `borrowedAmount` is calculated and this calculation will be executed. If the calculated `dailyRateCollateral` is less than 1000, it will be set to 1000.

```solidity
        //@audit DailyRateCollateral calculation
        cache.dailyRateCollateral = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            cache.borrowedAmount,
            cache.dailyRateCollateral,
            Constants.BP
        );
        // Check if the dailyRateCollateral is less than the minimum amount defined in the Constants contract
        if (cache.dailyRateCollateral < Constants.MINIMUM_AMOUNT) {
            cache.dailyRateCollateral = Constants.MINIMUM_AMOUNT;
        }
```

`dailyRateCollateral` means the amount of collateral the user has to pay daily. For example, if the user borrows 1000 USDT, his daily rate collateral will be 1000e18 * 10 / 10000 = 1e18 , which is about 1 USDT. This means that the user has to pay 1 USDT per day. Since 1e18 is greater than 1000, `dailyRateCollateral` will be 1e18.

However, if the borrowed token has extremely low decimals, for example EURS, and the user borrows 1000 EURS, his daily rate collateral will be 1000e2 * 10 / 10000 = 100. Since 100 < 1000, `dailyRateCollateral` will be set to 1000. This means that if the user borrows 1000 EURS, he has to pay 1000 EURS, instead of 0.1% of that amount.

Since the protocol uses UniswapV3 positions, it is expected to accommodate to all types of ERC20 tokens.

## Impact

Low token decimals will not work in this protocol, and if not careful, borrowers will overpay when calling `borrow()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend not adding the minimum sum. Also, recommend having a minimum amount to borrow and also probably whitelisting the types of tokens accepted to prevent low decimal issues all round.
