# Lack of Slippage Control For Liquidity Functions
## Summary

There is no slippage controls for depositing and withdrwaing uniswap liquidity

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a slippage parameter for swapping `swapSlippageBP1000` that is passed into Uniswap input parameters. However, this is different from liquidity slippage. The swap slippage only limits the price impact of opening and closing a position. However,  `amount0Min : 0` and `amount1Min: 0` means there is no slippage protection to price prevent manipulation frontrunning the liquidity deposits and withdrawals.

## Impact

Loss of funds due to slippage when extracting or restoring liquidity in functions such as `borrow` or `repay`

## Recommendation

Add `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` slippage parameters for liquidity deposits and withdrawals
