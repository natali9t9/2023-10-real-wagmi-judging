# No slippage protection when protocol increaseLiquidity and decreaseLiquidity cause user lose funds.
## Summary

No slippage protection when protocol increaseLiquidity and decreaseLiquidity cause user lose funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

When LiquidityManager#_increaseLiquidity called, which then called uniswap v3 INonfungiblePositionManager#increaseLiquidity.

However, amount0Min and amount1Min parameters is not set properly, which are used to prevent slippage.

https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/providing-liquidity/increase-liquidity
https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/providing-liquidity/decrease-liquidity

These parameters should be checked to create slippage protections.

Those functions are used in LiquidityBorrowingManager#borrow and LiquidityBorrowingManager#repay functions, which could cause protocol lose funds.

## Impact

Cause users lose funds when borrow or repay liquidity.
