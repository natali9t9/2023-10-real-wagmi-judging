# User may be unable to repay loan
## Summary
User may be unable to repay loan

## Vulnerability Detail
The restoreLiquidity() function, which is responsible for selling tokens on Uniswap, calculates the slippage tolerance of a swap by querying the Uniswap Quoter contract: then the returned amount is used to calculate minimal amount of tokens the swap must result in.

However, the Quoter contract is vulnerable to price manipulation attacks since it simply [performs a swap](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/lens/QuoterV2.sol#L138-L146) in the underlying Uniswap pools. A malicious actor can execute a sandwich attack, which will:
1. Manipulate the price of a Uniswap pool that swaps a hold token to sale token;
2. Returned saleTokenAmountOut will be zero or less than intended
```solidity
247:    (saleTokenAmountOut, cache.sqrtPriceX96, , ) = underlyingQuoterV2
```
3. saleTokenAmountOut used for calculating min amount out. So amountOutMinimum will be 0 or less than intended
```solidity
amountOutMinimum: (saleTokenAmountOut * params.slippageBP1000) / Constants.BPS
```
5. Then when swapping through _patchAmountsAndCallSwap or _v3SwapExactInput, the user may receive fewer tokens, making it impossible to restore liquidity due to the check in _increaseLiquidity()
```solidity
410:  if (restoredLiquidity < loan.liquidity) {
```
Additionally, there is another notable concern within the codebase. Numerous instances exist where 'amountMin' is hardcoded to 0 which is very unsafe.

## Impact
An attacker can prevent user from repaying their loan

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For second issue consider allowing users implement their own slippage
