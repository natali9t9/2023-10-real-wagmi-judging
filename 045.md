# Blindly adding 1 to amount0 and amount1 in _increaseLiquidity() can result in providing more liquidity than intended.
## Summary
When calculating amounts for increaseLiquidity(), it blindly adds 1 to amount0 and amount1. This could result in providing more liquidity than intended if those amounts were already at non-zero value. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Blindly adding 1 to amount0 and amount1 in _increaseLiquidity() can result in providing more liquidity than intended.
The relevant code is:

      function _increaseLiquidity(
          address saleToken, 
          address holdToken,
          LoanInfo memory loan,
          uint256 amount0,
          uint256 amount1
      ) private {

        if (amount0 > 0) ++amount0;

        if (amount1 > 0) ++amount1;

           // Call increaseLiquidity with increased amounts

      }


Here is how it can lead to excess liquidity:
• Let's say amount0 and amount1 originally had non-zero values, say 100 and 200 respectively
• The _increaseLiquidity() function blindly adds 1 to these amounts
• So now amount0 becomes 101 and amount1 becomes 201
• These new inflated amounts are passed to increaseLiquidity()
• More liquidity will be added than required, based on the original amount0 and amount1 values of 100 and 200
This introduces a vulnerability where an attacker could extract some liquidity from the position, and then exploit this blind increment to add more liquidity than they returned, effectively stealing funds.


## Impact
The impact is that if amount0 and amount1 already had non-zero values before calling _increaseLiquidity(), adding 1 to those values would increase the liquidity provided.
For example, if amount0 was 10 and amount1 was 20 before calling this function, they would be increased to 11 and 21 respectively. So the final liquidity provided would be higher than if the original amounts were used.
This introduces a vulnerability where an attacker could exploit this to steal funds by providing more liquidity than they should be able to.
In summary, the blind increment allows attackers to artificially modify liquidity holdings, disrupt pool accounting, and steal funds by depositing less assets than the liquidity added.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The increment should only happen if amount0 and amount1 values are 0 originally:

      if (amount0 == 0) {
        ++amount0; 
      }

      if (amount1 == 0) {
        ++amount1;
      }

This ensures the increment only happens to avoid rounding down from non-zero amounts to zero, but doesn't blindly add 1 in all cases.
So in summary, the blind increment can lead to excess liquidity vulnerability, and should be guarded to only apply when amount values are originally zero.
