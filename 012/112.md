# Borrower can devalue LP Position before borrowing or repaying to cheapen cost of restoring liquidity
## Summary

A borrower can devalue the liquidity position by making a high slippage/price impact Uniswap market order so that they can repay at a discounted token amount/value.


## Vulnerability Detail

When an `borrow` position is opened, the amount of `liquidity` based on the current prices of `token0` and `token1` is recorded. When the price of the tokens changes, converting the hold token and sale token and redpositing the liquidity does not yield the same result.

A borrower can cheapen the amount that is needed to restore a liquidity by making a high price impact swap through the Uniswap v3 pool which devalues the liquidity before calling `borrow`. Then, they can `repay` at the fair price for a profit.

## Impact

Borrower can steal funds from LP creditors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The liquidity has to be valued at a Uniswap TWAP oracle price which is difficult to manipulate, and the value of `token0` and `token1` that is restored in the liquidity should be greater or equal to the TWAP oracle determined fair price.
