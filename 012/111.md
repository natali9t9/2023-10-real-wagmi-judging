# Lender can manipulate liquidty value before `borrow` or`repay` to increase the amount borrower needs to repay
## Summary

When a borrower calls `repay` or `borrow`, the lender can increase the amount of liquidity the have to pay back by manipulating the Uniswap v3 pool price.

## Vulnerability Details 

When a borrower calls funds, the uniswap position values the tokens at the current tick price. When a borrower initiates a loan, the lender can push the price so that the hold token is overpriced relative to the swap token. This means that it requires more liquidity for the borrower to pay back the loan. 

The cost of liquidity position, even after exchaning tokens differs at different points in a price curve. 

This means that the borrower ultimately has to pay that inflated liquidity amount to the lender resulting in a large profit for them.

## Impact

Lender can steal funds from borrower.

## Recommendation

Add an optional slippage parameter(s) for `borrow` and `repay` functions to prevent frontrunning manipulation.
