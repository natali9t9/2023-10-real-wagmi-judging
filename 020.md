# The emergency loan closure logic can lead to inconsistent state and abuse compared to normal repayment.
## Summary
• Emergency loan closure can lead to inconsistent state compared to normal repayment
• Only removing the lender's loans causes this
• Should fully close out position if all loans removed
• Properly closing out state avoids inconsistencies

## Vulnerability Detail
The key functions are _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure and repay:

     function _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure(
       // args
     ) private returns (
       uint256 removedAmt, 
       uint256 feesAmt,
       bool completeRepayment
     ) {

       // Loop through loans
       for(uint i = 0; i < loans.length; i++) {
  
         // Only remove loans owned by msg.sender
    
         // Update removedAmt and feesAmt
    
       }

       // Return removedAmt, feesAmt, and completeRepayment
     }

     function repay(
       // args
     ) external {

       // Call _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure

       // If completeRepayment is true
         // Fully close out position (clear state)
       else 
         // Partially close out position

       // Transfer funds
  
     }

The issue is that _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure only partially closes out loans, but repay doesn't fully reset state if completeRepayment is true.

The emergency loan closure logic can lead to inconsistent state and abuse compared to normal repayment. Let's dive deep into how this works:
The key functions are _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure and repay.
In _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure, the contract loops through the loans for a borrowing position and removes any loans owned by the msg.sender (the lender). It calculates the removedAmt and feesAmt based on only the removed loans.
If all loans are removed, it sets completeRepayment = true.
The issues arise in repay function:
• If completeRepayment = true, it does NOT fully close out the position like in normal repayment. It only:
• Reduces borrowedAmount and feesOwed based on removedAmt
• Reduces totalBorrowed based on removedAmt
• Transfers removedAmt + feesAmt to lender
• So the position can still exist with borrowedAmount and feesOwed inconsistent with remaining loans
• And if completeRepayment = true, it indicates all loans removed but the position still exists
This can allow the borrower to continue using the position improperly.
For example:
• Borrower opens position with 2 loans, Loan A and Loan B
• Loan A owner (Lender A) uses emergency repayment
• This removes Loan A, and sets completeRepayment = true
• But position still exists with Loan B
• Borrower adds back more loans, increasing debt improperly

## Impact
Potential for borrower abuse: If loans and collateral balances are not fully reset, a malicious borrower could try to reuse a partially closed position to take out more loans. The incomplete reset enables this potential abuse.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 This can be mitigated by doing a full cleanup of the position's storage if completeRepayment is true.:

     function repay(
       // args
     ) external {

       // Call _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure

       if (completeRepayment) {
         // Full cleanup
         delete loansInfo[borrowingKey] 
         delete borrowingsInfo[borrowingKey]
         // Etc

       } else {
         // Partial cleanup
       }

       // Transfer funds

     }

This ensures the position storage is fully reset when all loans are removed.
