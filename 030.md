# Vulnerability where the current daily rate could be unintentionally defaulted to the Constants.DEFAULT_DAILY_RATE if it has not been properly set.
## Summary
The _getHoldTokenRateInfo() function does assume that the currentDailyRate is already set, but defaults it to Constants.DEFAULT_DAILY_RATE if it is not set. This could potentially allow the rate to be unintentionally defaulted
## Vulnerability Detail
the _getHoldTokenRateInfo() function does have a potential vulnerability where the current daily rate could be unintentionally defaulted to the Constants.DEFAULT_DAILY_RATE if it has not been properly set.
Here is how it works:
In _getHoldTokenRateInfo(), the currentDailyRate is first read from the TokenInfo struct in storage:

     currentDailyRate = holdTokenRateInfo.currentDailyRate;

Then this is checked:

     if (currentDailyRate == 0) {
       currentDailyRate = Constants.DEFAULT_DAILY_RATE; 
     }

If the currentDailyRate has not been explicitly set, it will be 0. So in this case, it will get defaulted to Constants.DEFAULT_DAILY_RATE.
This could lead to unintended behavior, as any calling contracts or users expecting a specific rate to be set would instead get the default rate.
For example, if a lending contract calls this to calculate fees owed, it may end up charging less interest than intended if the rate gets defaulted.

## Impact
Reduced expected revenue for lending activities due to lower interest rates. Incorrect interest fee calculations over time, leading to lost revenue for the protocol or unfair overcharging of users. The error compounds the more the contract is used.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should explicitly prevent defaulting in _getHoldTokenRateInfo():

     if (currentDailyRate == 0) {
       revert("Current daily rate not set");
     }

And require the calling contract to properly set the rate first via a separate write function or constructor before calling _getHoldTokenRateInfo(). This way there is no risk of accidentally relying on the default rate.
