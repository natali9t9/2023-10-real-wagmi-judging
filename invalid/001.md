# Inadequate Validation of Token Balance Data in ``getBalances`` Function
## Summary
The ``getBalances`` function in the provided smart contract lacks proper validation of the token balance data returned by the ``staticcall``. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities and inaccurate token balance reporting.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``getBalances`` function iterates through an array of token addresses and uses ``staticcall`` to invoke the ``balanceOf`` function on each token contract. However, the code only checks the success of the ``staticcall`` and the length of the data returned. It does not verify the actual content of the data, making it susceptible to malicious or misbehaving token contracts.

## Impact
The inadequate validation of token balance data can have the following security and usability impacts:

- Security Risks: Malicious or misconfigured token contracts can return incorrect data, leading to security vulnerabilities or manipulation of reported token balances.
- Inaccurate Reporting: Users relying on the ``getBalances`` function may receive incorrect balance information, affecting the integrity of their transactions and decisions.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/Vault.sol#L37

```solidity
function getBalances(
        address[] calldata tokens
    ) external view returns (uint256[] memory balances) {
        bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(this));
        uint256 length = tokens.length;
        balances = new uint256[](length);
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ) {
            (bool success, bytes memory data) = tokens[i].staticcall(callData);
            require(success && data.length >= 32);
            balances[i] = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to enhance the security and accuracy of the getBalances function by performing thorough data validation. This can be achieved by implementing the following changes to the code:

- Check that the staticcall is successful.
- Verify the length of the data returned to ensure it matches the expected length for an uint256.
- Validate the content of the data to ensure it represents a non-negative token balance.

```solidity
function getBalances(
    address[] calldata tokens
) external view returns (uint256[] memory balances) {
    bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(this));
    uint256 length = tokens.length;
    balances = new uint256[](length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = tokens[i].staticcall(callData);
        require(success && data.length == 32);
+      uint256 tokenBalance = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
-       balances[i] = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
+      require(tokenBalance >= 0, "Negative token balance");
+      balances[i] = tokenBalance;
        unchecked {
            ++i;
         }
    }
}
