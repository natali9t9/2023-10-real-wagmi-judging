# _v3SwapExactInput() lack of the deadline parameter
## Summary
_v3SwapExactInput() lack of the deadline parameter
## Vulnerability Detail
Without a deadline parameter, the transaction may sit in the mempool and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in a worse price.
## Impact
Please refer to the [Uniswap V3 doc](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps) for the design of the "swapExactInputSingle" parameters.
Includes a deadline parameter to protect against long-pending transactions and wild swings in prices
In ApproveSwapAndPay.sol, when usingÂ  _v3SwapExactInput() to perform a token swap using Uniswap V3 with exact input, deadline parameter should be added to avoid transactions waiting for an extended period in the mempool before execution.
