# Borrowers can abuse the ability to repay loans while still owing fees.
## Summary
The repay function in LiquidityBorrowingManager contract allows the borrower to repay their loan even if the collateralBalance is negative.
## Vulnerability Detail
Borrowers are allowed to repay loans even when the collateralBalance is negative.
Here is how it works:
In the repay() function, there is a check that allows the borrower to proceed if either:
1. msg.sender == borrowing.borrower OR
2. collateralBalance >= 0

This means that even if the collateralBalance is negative, the borrower can still call repay() and proceed, since the first condition is satisfied (msg.sender will be the borrower).
The impact of this is that borrowers could potentially walk away without fully repaying the lender if the collateralBalance is negative. When collateralBalance is negative, it means the borrower owes more in fees/interest than what they originally deposited as collateral. By allowing them to repay even in this scenario, they can get away without paying those additional fees they owe.
The relevant code is here:

          (msg.sender != borrowing.borrower && collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(
                      ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_CALLER
                  );


## Impact
• Borrowers can walk away from their debt by repaying only a portion of what they owe. This leaves the lender at a loss.
• It incentivizes borrowers to take risky leveraged positions without needing to repay the full debt if the trade goes against them.

In essence - Borrowers can abuse the ability to repay loans while still owing fees.

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
This check should be updated to:

       (msg.sender != borrowing.borrower || collateralBalance >= 0).revertError(
                   ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_CALLER
               );

By changing the AND to an OR, it will prevent borrowers from repaying unless they either are the original borrower OR have a non-negative collateral balance. This mitigates the potential vulnerability by ensuring borrowers cannot walk away without paying fees they owe if collateralBalance is negative. . This will prevent borrowers from abusing the ability to repay loans while still owing fees.
