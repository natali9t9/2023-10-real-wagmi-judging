# Using block.timestamp as deadline is still dangerous
## Summary
Using block.timestamp as deadline is still dangerous
## Vulnerability Detail
shouldn't set the deadline to block.timestamp as a validator can hold the transaction and the block it is eventually put into will be block.timestamp, so this offers no protection.

## Impact
It may be more profitable for a miner to deny the transaction from being mined until the transaction incurs the maximum amount of slippage.
A malicious miner can hold the transaction as deadline is set to block.timestamp which means that whenever the miner decides to include the transaction in a block, it will be valid at that time, since block.timestamp will be the current timestamp. The transaction might be left hanging in the mempool and be executed way later than the user wanted. The malicious miner can hold the transaction and execute the transaction only when he is profitable and no error would also be thrown as it will be valid at that time, since block.timestamp will be the current timestamp.
