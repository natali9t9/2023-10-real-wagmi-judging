# use of block.timestamp for deadline on increase liquidity and decrease liquidity
## Summary
The use of `block.timestamp` as the deadline for increaseLiquidity operation can allow miners keep the transaction for longer until it is profitable for them.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
(uint128 restoredLiquidity, , ) = underlyingPositionManager.increaseLiquidity(
            INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: loan.tokenId,
                amount0Desired: amount0,
                amount1Desired: amount1,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
```
## Impact
Loss of funds by the user during market swings

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow timestamp be passed by the user offchain. This can be done on the frontend with `currentTimestamp` + 10 minutes
