# MAX_NUM_USER_POSOTION can be bypassed
## Summary

MAX_NUM_USER_POSOTION can be bypassed by 1 position.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol`, if the user calls `borrow()` or `takeOverDebt()` and if the borrowed amount is 0, then the borrow position is a new position. This position will be added to the `allUserBorrowingKeys` struct.

However, the check for maximum number of position is called first before pushing the array:

```solidity
File: LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol
817:         if (!update) {
818:             // If it's a new position, ensure that the user does not have too many positions
819:             bytes32[] storage allUserBorrowingKeys = userBorrowingKeys[msg.sender];
820:             (allUserBorrowingKeys.length > Constants.MAX_NUM_USER_POSOTION).revertError(
821:                 ErrLib.ErrorCode.TOO_MANY_USER_POSITIONS
822:             );
823:             // Add the borrowingKey to the user's borrowing keys
824:             allUserBorrowingKeys.push(borrowingKey);
825:         }
```

If the max number of user position is 10, and there are 10 positions so far, the check will pass and a new, 11 position will be pushed into the mapping, which should not be the case. 

## Impact

Max user position will be overcounted by 1

## Recommendation

Add the borrowingKey to the user's borrowing keys first before checking for the max number of position.
