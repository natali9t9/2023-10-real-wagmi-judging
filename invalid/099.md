# The mismatch between expected and hardcoded slippage will cause the protocol to frequently revert on `borrow` and `repay`, disrupting normal work
## Summary
The protocol has checks whether removing/adding liquidity/swapping matches the expected value (to prevent excessive slippage). However these checks are implemented not within those particular uniswap (or other AMM if integrated in the future - I will use example of uniswap here) interactions, but *post* them, while those uniswap interactions do not include proper slippage protection themselves. Due to this, the protocol receives contradictory requests - the swaps are allowed to have slippage, but later on there is a check if there was in fact none, or limited slippage. As slippage is a common thing, the core operations `borrow` and `repay` may frequently revert. In worst case, the protocol will be hardly usable during times of market turbulences.

## Vulnerability Detail
When interacting with Uniswapv3, to protect against excessive slippage, users may choose to set parameters of functions such as increasing/decreasing liquidity or swapping - minimum amount and deadline. But these checks have to be used within the function call arguments, so the uniswap processes these requests accordingly. Setting them to none has a great chance that these calls will be processed by uniswap as per the arguments (so with any slippage) and unfavourable operation will return less than expected funds back. If the check is implemented later on, the transaction will revert. Especially during high volatility periods, users might have to call borrow/repay multiple time to even succeed.

## Impact
Users may lose funds, because they will not be able to repay on time (so get liquidated), or not be able to liquidate someone on time (lose liquidation bonus), or borrow - in short, use protocol as they should be at all.
Frequently failing protocol may discourage users to use it at all, impairing the whole point of existence of the protocol.

## Code Snippet
1. `Borrow`: At [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L465), in [_precalculateBorrowing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L833), in [_extractLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L209) and its call to [_decreaseLiquidity ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L349) 

```solidity
    function _decreaseLiquidity(uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity) private {
        // Call the decreaseLiquidity function of underlyingPositionManager contract
        // with DecreaseLiquidityParams struct as argument
        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = underlyingPositionManager.decreaseLiquidity(
            INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
```

Also further the `saleToken` is swapped with [amountOutMinimum equal to zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L875-L893).


```solidity
            if (params.externalSwap.swapTarget != address(0)) {
                // Call the external swap function and update the hold token balance in the cache
                cache.holdTokenBalance += _patchAmountsAndCallSwap(
                    params.saleToken,
                    params.holdToken,
                    params.externalSwap,
                    saleTokenBalance,
                    0
                );
            } else {
                // Call the internal v3SwapExactInput function and update the hold token balance in the cache
                cache.holdTokenBalance += _v3SwapExactInput(
                    v3SwapExactInputParams({
                        fee: params.internalSwapPoolfee,
                        tokenIn: params.saleToken,
                        tokenOut: params.holdToken,
                        amountIn: saleTokenBalance,
                        amountOutMinimum: 0
                    })
```

As the swap is performed without any minimal returned value requirement, it will be processed accordingly to it, but further [this line checks the slippage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L899-L901)

```solidity
        if (cache.holdTokenBalance < params.minHoldTokenOut) {
            revert TooLittleReceivedError(params.minHoldTokenOut, cache.holdTokenBalance);
        }
```



2. `Repay`: At [repay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L532) in operation [_restoreLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L223) and later in [_increaseLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L386)

Especially stargin from line 398:
```solidity
        (uint128 restoredLiquidity, , ) = underlyingPositionManager.increaseLiquidity(
            INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: loan.tokenId,
                amount0Desired: amount0,
                amount1Desired: amount1,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
```
The liquidity is added without any slippage checks (no minimum amount and no timestamp requirements which is prone to tx reordering) but later if it doesnt meet requirements, [transaction reverts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L410C2-L417C45).

```solidity
        if (restoredLiquidity < loan.liquidity) {
            // Get the balance of holdToken and saleToken
            (uint256 holdTokentBalance, uint256 saleTokenBalance) = _getPairBalance(
                holdToken,
                saleToken
            );

            revert InvalidRestoredLiquidity(
[...]
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The slippage requirement should be enforced on uniswap call level instead of being separate checks after those calls.
