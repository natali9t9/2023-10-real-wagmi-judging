# The loop counter i is incremented without checks on the length of the tokens array. This can cause an overflow and potentially overwrite memory.
## Summary
• Incrementing a loop counter without checks can cause overflow and memory corruption
• Should validate the counter against array length before incrementing
• Bounded increment prevents out of bounds access

## Vulnerability Detail
The loop counter `i` is incremented without checking the length of the tokens array. This can cause an overflow and potentially overwrite memory.
Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

     function getBalances(address[] calldata tokens) external view returns (uint256[] memory balances) {

       uint256 length = tokens.length;
  
       balances = new uint256[](length);

       for (uint256 i; i < length; ) {
         // i is incremented without bounds checking
         unchecked {
           ++i; 
         }
       }
     }

If tokens has a length of 0, then length will be 0. But the loop will still increment i, causing it to become 1, then 2, etc. This will overwrite memory outside the bounds of the balances array.
## Impact
1. Incrementing the loop counter i without checking the length of the loans array is dangerous and can lead to memory corruption.
2. the unchecked loop counter increment can lead to unauthorized modifications of critical contract storage variables. This has a huge potential impact - from simple errors and bugs at best, to exploitability and stolen funds at worst.

## Recommendation
To fix this, the increment should be bounded by the length:

     for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
       // do stuff

       if (i < length - 1) { 
         ++i; 
       }
     }

Now `i` can only increment up to` length - 1`, preventing the overflow.
