# Vulnerability where minPayment could be 0 if the collateral balance is positive, allowing takeover without proper collateral.
## Summary
The calculation of minPayment depends on the collateral balance being negative. If positive, minPayment could be 0 which would allow takeover without proper collateral. 
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a potential vulnerability in the takeOverDebt function where minPayment could be 0 if the collateral balance is positive, allowing takeover without proper collateral.

If the collateral balance is positive, minPayment could potentially be 0 which would allow a takeover of the debt without providing proper collateral.
The key parts of the code related to this are:
1.  Calculating the collateral balance:

         (int256 collateralBalance, uint256 currentFees) = _calculateCollateralBalance(
           oldBorrowing.borrowedAmount, 
           oldBorrowing.accLoanRatePerSeconds,
           oldBorrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance,
           accLoanRatePerSeconds
         );
2. Calculating minPayment based on the collateral balance:

         minPayment = (uint256(-collateralBalance) / Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION) + 1;

3. Validating the provided collateralAmt against minPayment:

         (collateralAmt <= minPayment).revertError(
           ErrLib.ErrorCode.COLLATERAL_AMOUNT_IS_NOT_ENOUGH
         );

The vulnerability arises because if collateralBalance is positive, minPayment will be calculated as 0 + 1 = 1.
This means the collateral validation would pass as long as collateralAmt >= 1, allowing the takeover without proper collateral.

This means if the old borrower has a positive collateral balance, the new borrower can take over the debt by only providing 1 wei of collateral, which is insecure.

Attackers could take over loans that are well collateralized by providing minimal collateral. This could drain collateral from the protocol when the attackers default on the loans.



## Impact
 1. It would allow someone to take over a debt without providing proper collateral, leaving the protocol undercollateralized.

2. Undercollateralization of the lending protocol over time as debts are taken over without proper collateral being provided. This could lead to insolvency of the protocol if debts are not able to be repaid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The minPayment calculation should be changed to:

       minPayment = collateralBalance < 0 ? 
                     (uint256(-collateralBalance) / Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION) + 1 :
                     1;
This will ensure minPayment is at least 1 even if collateralBalance is positive. The takeover collateral validation will then properly enforce a minimum amount of collateral for the debt takeover.
