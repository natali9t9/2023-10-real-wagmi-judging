# No slippage protection on _decreaseLiquidity call
## Summary
Inside `liquidityManager` we call NonfungiblePositionManager v3 to decrease the liquidity of a position, but the problem is that we don't provide valid params for `amount0Min` `amount1Min`, which it the protection against slippages.
## Vulnerability Detail
The only check is wether the returned values are greater than 0, which is not enough 
```solidity
 if (amount0 == 0 && amount1 == 0) {
     revert InvalidBorrowedLiquidity(tokenId);
}
```
You can see in the [docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/providing-liquidity/increase-liquidity) it is written that `In production, amount0Min and amount1Min should be adjusted to create slippage protections.`
## Impact
This could result in potential lost of funds

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Implement recommended params for slippage protection with valid values and check the returned values.
```solidity
   (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = underlyingPositionManager.decreaseLiquidity(
            INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: validValue,
                amount1Min: validValue,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
        // Check if both amount0 and amount1 are zero after decreasing liquidity
        // If true, revert with InvalidBorrowedLiquidity exception
        if (amount0 <  amount0Min || amount1 < amount1Min) {
            revert InvalidBorrowedLiquidity(tokenId);
        }
```
