# `_patchAmountsAndCallSwap() will not operate correctly
## Summary
The `amountOutMin` parameter is set to 0 when passed to the `_patchAmountsAndCallSwap()` function. Consequently, the subsequent check to ensure that amountOut is greater than amountOutMin will always fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The  function `ApproveSwapAndPay._patchAmountsAndCallSwap()` is used  for executing token swaps within the protocol, ensuring that the external swap targets are appropriately approved and that the swaps meet the specified criteria.
The function verifies whether the received amount meets the minimum requirement specified by amountOutMin. If the received amount is zero or falls short of the minimum requirement, the function will revert the transaction.
```solidity
     amountOut = _getBalance(tokenOut) - balanceOutBefore;
        // Checking if the received amount satisfies the minimum requirement
        if (amountOut == 0 || amountOut < amountOutMin) {
            revert SwapSlippageCheckError(amountOutMin, amountOut);
        }

```

In the `LiquidityBorrowingManager._precalculateBorrowing()` function, the `amountOutMin` parameter is being set to 0 when it's passed to the `_patchAmountsAndCallSwap()` function. This configuration means that the subsequent check, if (amountOut == 0 || amountOut < amountOutMin), will always fail.
```solidity
   if (saleTokenBalance > 0) {
            if (params.externalSwap.swapTarget != address(0)) {
                // Call the external swap function and update the hold token balance in the cache
                cache.holdTokenBalance += _patchAmountsAndCallSwap(
                    params.saleToken,
                    params.holdToken,
                    params.externalSwap,
                    saleTokenBalance,
                    0
                );
```

## Impact
The subsequent check to ensure that `amountOut` is greater than `amountOutMin` will always fail

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it's important to correctly set the amountOutMin parameter based on the specific requirements of the swap and the expected output.
