# Rounding down the collected amounts to uint128 in _decreaseLiquidity can potentially cause issues with lost precision when restoring liquidity in _increaseLiquidity.
## Summary
Rounding down the collected amounts to uint128 in _decreaseLiquidity can potentially cause issues with lost precision when restoring liquidity in _increaseLiquidity. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Rounding down the collected amounts to uint128 in _decreaseLiquidity can potentially cause issues with lost precision when restoring liquidity in _increaseLiquidity. Here is a more detailed explanation:
The collect function in _decreaseLiquidity rounds the collected amounts to uint128:

      (amount0, amount1) = underlyingPositionManager.collect(
        INonfungiblePositionManager.CollectParams({
          tokenId: tokenId,  
          recipient: address(this),
          amount0Max: uint128(amount0), 
          amount1Max: uint128(amount1)
        })
      );

Later in _increaseLiquidity, these uint128 amounts are passed directly to increaseLiquidity:

      (uint128 restoredLiquidity, , ) = underlyingPositionManager.increaseLiquidity(
        INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
          tokenId: loan.tokenId,
          amount0Desired: amount0, 
          amount1Desired: amount1,
          ...
         })
      );
The issue is that increaseLiquidity expects the full uint256 amounts, so passing the rounded uint128 values can lead to lost precision.
For example, let's say the actual collected amounts are:
•	amount0 = 10000000000000001
•	amount1 = 20000000000000001
When rounded to uint128, these become:
•	amount0 = 10000000000000001
•	amount1 = 20000000000000000
Now the lost precision in amount1 results in less liquidity being restored than expected.

## Impact
Some amount of tokens may be left unaccounted for when increasing liquidity back in _increaseLiquidity().

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The collect amounts should be kept as uint256 and only rounded when passing to increaseLiquidity:

      // Collect amounts as uint256
      (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = underlyingPositionManager.collect(...);

      // Only round down when passing to increaseLiquidity
      (uint128 restoredLiquidity, , ) = underlyingPositionManager.increaseLiquidity(
        INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
          amount0Desired: uint128(amount0), 
          amount1Desired: uint128(amount1), 
          ...
        })
      );

This ensures no precision is lost before increasing liquidity. The uint128 conversion is still needed for increaseLiquidity but done as late as possible.
