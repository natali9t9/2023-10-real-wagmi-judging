# Users do not pay the plataformFees
## Summary
**`_pickUpPlatformFees()`** is designed to calculate protocol fees that users are required to pay. However and error in the formula to calculate it provocates that never will be paid.
## Vulnerability Detail
**`_pickUpPlatformFees()`** calulcates the fees protocol **`platformFees = (fees * platformFeesBP) / Constants.BP`**. 

Next calulates **`currentFees = fees - platformFees`**.

However, a critical issue arises when calculating **currentFees** as it incorrectly subtracts the **platformFees** from the total user fees. This error results in the user being charged fewer fees than required, rather than more.
```Solidity
function _pickUpPlatformFees(
        address holdToken,
        uint256 fees
    ) private returns (uint256 currentFees) {
        uint256 platformFees = (fees * platformFeesBP) / Constants.BP;
        platformsFeesInfo[holdToken] += platformFees;
        currentFees = fees - platformFees;  
    }
```
## Impact
Users pays less fees and never pays the plataform fees.

## Recommendation
Change the formula for the following:
**`currentFees = fees + platformFees`**
