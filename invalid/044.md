# Lack of slippage protection when reducing liquidity
## Summary
When calling Uniswap V3's `decreaseLiquidityParams()`, both `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` are set to zero. This absence of minimum acceptable amounts (slippage protection) could lead to unintended consequences during liquidity reduction. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `LiquidityManager._decreaseLiquidity()`, when calling Uniswap V3's `decreaseLiquidity()`, setting both `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` to 0 essentially means that there is no slippage protection in place. This omission of slippage protection can lead to several issues, mainly due to the lack of a minimum expected amount for each asset when decreasing liquidity in a Uniswap V3 position.
```solidity
  function _decreaseLiquidity(uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity) private {
        // Call the decreaseLiquidity function of underlyingPositionManager contract
        // with DecreaseLiquidityParams struct as argument
        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = underlyingPositionManager.decreaseLiquidity(
            INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );

## Recommendation
It is advisable to set appropriate minimum amounts for both `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` when interacting with Uniswap V3's `decreaseLiquidityParams()`.
