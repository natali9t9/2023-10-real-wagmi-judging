# Loss of precision in divisions
### <a name="L-3"></a>[L-3] Loss of precision in divisions

#### Impact:
Division by large numbers may result in the result being zero, due to Solidity not supporting fractions. Consider requiring a minimum amount for the numerator to ensure that it is always larger than the denominator.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity

```
