# Use Ownable2Step rather than Ownable
### <a name="L-5"></a>[L-5] Use Ownable2Step rather than Ownable

#### Impact:
Ownable2Step and Ownable2StepUpgradeable prevent the contract ownership from mistakenly being transferred to an address that cannot handle it, by requiring the recipient of the owner permissions to actively accept via a contract call of its own.

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: LiqBorrowingMan/Vault.sol

8: contract Vault is Ownable, IVault {

```

```solidity
File: LiqBorrowingMan/abstract/OwnerSettings.sol

6: abstract contract OwnerSettings is Ownable {

```
