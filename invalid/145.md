# no slippage lead to loss of fund
## Summary
there is no  slippage check when swapping the sale token into **holdtoken** which can lead to loss of fund
## Vulnerability Detail which 
in **liquidityBorrowigManager** line 742 - 761 will try to swap sale token into the **holdtoken** when swapping the slippage arguments are zero which means there is no check for slippage which will open a door for mev and and mev searcher can do a sandwich attack every time the borrow function  first the searcher will listen to a **memepool**  for the borrow function to be called then it will **frontrun** the trx and buy big amount of hold token due to that the price will go up then when the borrow function swap the sell token  into the hold token   he will reveice small amount of **holdtoken** and will pump more the **holdtoken** then the **mev** searcher will sell the **holdtoken** again which he will gain a profit
## Impact
