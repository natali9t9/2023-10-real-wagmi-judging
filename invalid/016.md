# LiquidityBorrowingManager#_addKeysAndLoansInfo() - user can have more than the allowed positions
## Summary
The ``_addKeysAndLoansInfo`` is used to add loans and in case of new positions, push them to an array of positions owner by a specific  user. There is a constant ``Constants.MAX_NUM_USER_POSOTION`` that limits the max positions to 10, but the check for it is incorrect, thus leading to an off-by-one error.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon calling the ``_addKeysAndLoansInfo`` function, requesting to add loans to a newly open positions, when adding the loans they are first pushed into the loans array and then the array's length is checked against the constant for the invariant.
However, when opening a new positions the reverse is done: first the invariant is checked that the positions array's length does not exceed the limit and then the new item is pushed. Thus if we are at the limit of 10 and try to open a new positions, instead of reverting we would create an 11th one since the pushing happens after the ``if`` check.

## Impact
Broken protocol constant, above intended positions per user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Swap the pushing operation and the ``if`` check's orders like so:
```solidity
            bytes32[] storage allUserBorrowingKeys = userBorrowingKeys[msg.sender];
            allUserBorrowingKeys.push(borrowingKey);
           
            (allUserBorrowingKeys.length > Constants.MAX_NUM_USER_POSOTION).revertError(
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.TOO_MANY_USER_POSITIONS
            );
```
