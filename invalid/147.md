# Unbounded loop in `collectProtocol` function can leads to DOS
## Summary
unbounded loop in `collectProtocol` function can lead to Denail of Service

## Vulnerability Detail
the `collectProtocol` function allows owner to collect protocol fees for multiple tokens and transfer them to a specified recipient.the loop inside this function iterate through array of tokens and calculate amount i.e protocol fees and if `amount>0` then it transfer the amount to `recipient` address i.e the address of the recipient who will receive the collected fees and it  tranfer's the amount by call's the IERC20's  `safeTransfer` function .with all this happening in the loop and costing gas and executing gas costly function like `safeTransfer()` for all tokens in this loop can leads to dos due to exceeding the block size gas limit.

## Impact
there can be many tokens that the loop have to go through and calculate the protocal fees and tranfering the protocol fees to recipient address in the loop by using gas costly executions like `safeTransfer()` can lead to fail of execution due to exceeding block size gas limit

## Tool used
VS code

## Recommendation
avoide all the actions executed in a single transaction, especially when transfer's are executed as part of a loop.
